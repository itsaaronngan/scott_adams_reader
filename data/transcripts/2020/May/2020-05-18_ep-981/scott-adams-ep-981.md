Hey, it's time for no coffee with Scott Adams because it's too late at night. But it is time to find out more about the Golden Age. The Golden Ages comes. 

Yeah, It turns out that this coronavirus was like the third act. It's the thing we have to get past. I'll lay it out for you in a moment. We're going to keep the theme alive that, at least for the rest of Sunday we're gonna have positive thoughts. All positive thoughts are they really are there. Realistic? Doesn't matter for today. 

We're gonna wrap ourselves in a cocoon of positive thoughts and I've got a whiteboard to take it home. How would you like to see the whiteboard? All right, here's the set up. For all of the time that I have been alive, things have been based on basically something that evolved from, I don't know, the [1930s], [such as] the house that many people live in. 

If you live in a house the type of structure was probably designed...100 years ago. But our lives have changed completely. So we're living in a world that was designed for other people. It's a big thought. We're living in a world designed for other people. People who are not alive anymore. Our design ideas of what a house is; what a community is; what a city is; what a street is; what a school is; that is a system, and a bunch of systems, that work together. They were designed for other people. We don't live like those people. We're not those people. Those people died decades ago. 

What was what was preventing us from building something for us? Why were we putting up with these incremental little tweaks to somebody else's civilization that we just happened to be living in? Well, we put up with it because it's hard to change things. They just keep on going. It's hard to change anything, but also [it's hard to change] our minds. 

Did you know you were living in somebody else's world? Have you ever once have that thought [this]? Did you get up in the morning and looked around saying, "you know, everything I'm gonna experience today was designed for somebody who died 100 years ago. The road was there." 

Yeah, yeah, maybe cars weren't there, But basically you're living in somebody else's world. And the coronavirus just changed that.  Because the one of the things that the coronavirus did, that I think will be the least appreciated affect, is it [causing us to] rethink everything from scratch. 

How do I go to school? How do I commute [to] work(I don't even interact with my own family) when you have to start from scratch and rethink everything? Suddenly it becomes clear to you that you were living in someone else's world completely, and you had bought into it like that was okay. It was sort of like...some animal takes over another animals den and just moves in. But they're not really an animal that lives in the den. 

It would be like being a tiger [that] goes and lives in [a] bird's nest. Tigers don't belong in bird nests, they don't fit. But if the Tiger was asleep in its mind, [and] just didn't know much about his reality...it wouldn't know the difference. 

That's the world that you've been living in your entire life. You've been a tiger in the bird's nest until the coronavirus. You thought maybe that was okay cause it was just what you're used to. So now, having been forced to rethink everything (sidetrack: Um, so once again, somebody's confused about analogies. Let me pause to clean this up. No, I have never said analogies are worthless. They're worthless for persuasion. Specifically, they're great for describing a new concept, which is the way I just used it. If I go to persuade you, I try to persuade you with an analogy. Watch how it doesn't work. That's a lesson. It won't work. You could see it for yourself if I ever try. It's not gonna persuade you, I promise. But as an explanation of something new, they're great.) All right, here's what's gonna change. Guaranteed. We're living in the legacy systems, all of our systems are legacy. Meaning it's something built for a prior time. 

Here is the way this could give. Fixed on this is the way you would design anything if you knew how to design. All right? So you wouldn't. (to chat room: Whoever said change my world, baby, you made me laugh.) All right, so the way you would design anything if you really knew how to design things is that first you would live with a family, you would actually embed yourself with a variety of different families, and you would actually watch what they do during the day because you're going to try to ultimately design a new place for them to live with new systems from scratch. So first you see what they actually do. 

Let's say you see [the mom] down. Mom comes down, she's she starts to leave the door, and she forgot her keys. So she's got to walk all the way upstairs again. She gets the keys, and she comes all the way back down, and she forgot her wallet. She has to go all the way upstairs again, get a wallet and come all the way back down. Now you're the observer, and you're saying "Okay, what's wrong with this system?" How about if we're gonna design this community from scratch? How about you never need keys? Just biometrics. How about you don't have to ever go back and get your keys? How about if we don't have physical money and credit cards? What if it's just also biometrics? Or it could be your phone. So what if you just get rid of all those things that made Mom annoyed for those five minutes? 

Then you keep watching and it's everything from the way we do homework. Let's say the kids were home and there. There's no place to do homework, and they're laying on their beds doing homework. Now, a lot of kids like to do their homework on the bed, but it's the worst place to do it. You should be sitting up properly, and you should have a table, and you should have a proper light and away from the other noise. So the researcher says [reinvent] homework. But even more, why go to school at all? Maybe there should be one or two spaces in the home in which you've got a big enough screen and some headphones, and a kid or two could take classes. And it's actually optimized as a room for learning. That's just what it does. It's not a TV room. It's a learning room. 

Now these are just ideas. The point is that if you don't actually [spend] time and [record] what people do, how could you possibly design a better system? Now? Do you think that homebuilders do this? Do you think that there's a major home builder who's studying things from the from the bottom up to build a perfect house? I don't think so. Here's what I think the homebuilder does. I think a homebuilder [builds] what sold well last time, and what [is selling well for] competitors. I think they build the house that they know how to build... You don't wanna take five years figuring out how to build a house. You want to build the house you know how to build that's very similar to the ones that people are buying. Try a little something to see if anybody buys more of those, test your way through it. But I'll tell you what they're not doing. They're not starting from scratch to ask "How do people live in 2020 and beyond?". But they could. 

So let's say that you've done that (studied how people live), and now you know how people live. And what a proper house needs to have next would be what I call ideal room designs. Why do we have a 1,000,000 different looks for every room? Because I guarantee you that there are some room designs that are close to universally right and suddenly just aren't as good. Why don't we standardize on some rooms standard bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, etcetera, living room that could be easily furnished. But here's the thing; everything from the light, to the colors to the textures, how easy it is to maintain it and everything. You consider all of these things, and then you make each room like it's a separate product. 

All right, so a bedroom would be a product. And if you wanted to live in home, you could buy three bedrooms, and then you could put them together in an arrangement. Maybe not an incidently different arrangement, but a few set structures so you'd have perfect rooms. And then you get your systems engineers involved to not just design a home, because that's that's what we've done before. (aside: If all you're doing is designing home and you plop it in the middle of other homes that were also designed just to be homes, you haven't really designed this system) So you need your systems engineers to come in and say "Okay, what's the ideal size for a community that won't make it too big? Won't make it too small? What we gonna do about energy, how we're gonna make this thing green? What's the best engineering for that? Shall we put it around a generation for nuclear power plant? You know, how do we do this? You probably wanted to have your own banking."

Is there any reason a new community built from scratch couldn't just have an automatic digital bank and just everybody has that bank and they could have other banks to? But if you're living in the Community Homeowners association, or the town or whatever, just has some software that's your bank. So it's just a software bank. Maybe you'd have a software insurance to, and you might have software that sort of the backbone of this whole thing. Running it. You'd have to make sure that you had the [?] of the transportation. 

I'll just throw out some wild ideas. If you are going to build a community today from scratch, would you build each home so it could accommodate a drone landing on the roof? Maybe the drone is just delivering small packages and stuff. But would you consider that the original design that probably drones will be delivering small stuff so you don't have to drive to the store? Maybe so. Maybe you'd have underground walkways, underground transportation. 

But anyway, the engineers would figure that out as well as everything from health care to security and figuring out what kind of nature [?]. (Aside: I'm gonna start deleting anybody. I could block anybody who mentions communism or were socialism. Okay, because there's nothing in anything you're going to see that is even remotely like that. Okay, uh, so if anybody starts saying that's communism, you're taking my freedom or whatever. I'm just gonna block you because you're not ready for this.)

All right, so those are the first 3 phases, all very doable, I think you can see. And then here's the fun part. Start building home kits Lego like, meaning that you can snap them together. Should be so easy that you could hire your Uber driver to assemble your house for you now. Not specifically an Uber driver. But the point is, unskilled labor should be able to take these blocks and say, oh, here's the directions, here's the YouTube video for today's work. These blocks...there's only one place they could go. Boom. No cutting would be involved. No cutting, no sawing, no resize. And everything would be the right size. because, let's say the floor panels are all squares, so you might have different sized rooms, depending on your needs, but they would always be true to the one foot square, so you never have to cut them. You just add another square or not, but you never have to cut anything. You make it low maintenance, and you make it one level because you could assemble one level more easily. Now, I don't know how exactly you would do the the the the foundation part to make sure that it's got everything it needs. But I think engineers could figure that out. And even the plumbing and the electrical could be just different components where you say, OK, I need some electrical here. So you put in a you snap on a different kind of component that has a pipe of it. So that would be the basic idea. 

Now you wouldn't build it yourself necessarily. Like I said, it could be built by unskilled labourers so you could have your landscaper, [they] help you or whatever, so you wouldn't have to do it yourself. Then, once you've got some kits, you find some places to test them. It could be in a brand new location. Could be where some urban blight has been cleared. Bill Pulte[?]. You know the Blade Authority? You've heard this where largest swaths of broken down. You know, stuff in the inner cities has been removed,and and it's just available, so why not try something there? You don't have to relax the codes, and I think the coronavirus helps us there, too. Because if you relax some of the building codes, you could do a lot more obviously.

And I think that we saw so many codes and regulations being relaxed during the coronavirus that we just sort of feel like that's a thing now. It didn't feel like it was a thing before, right to get rid of any red tape. But now we just got rid of massive amounts of red tape and we all lived through it and that your mind is a little primed. Your thinking. Well, why don't I get rid of some more red tape [since] that worked out pretty well. So there is something about being the right time in the right place, which is happening right now. We should also think about the design of the communities in terms of who lives there, which might be more important to your overall happiness than anything else. Let me give you a provocative thought that I have today that's gonna blow your mind. You ready? This might be the one thing you remember at this periscope. I promise it will make your brain hurt here it is do you think that drug addicts have a drug problem, or do they have some kind of a self control problem? 

You probably think it's one of those right. It's either a drug problem, as some people would say, or it's about the individual. There's something they need to fix of themselves. That's probably the two ways that people look at it, or a combination of the two things. Let me give you a new frame. Drug addicts are allergic to other people who are not drug addicts. The danger for a drug addict is the other people because [they are who bring drugs]. 

We're into a place where addicts would otherwise be by themselves...Obviously an addict sometimes gets drugs. The point says if you have a city where there were nothing but addicts who would...build a liquor store there? Nobody, because you couldn't make any money. So if the world was only addicts and there were no non addicts, the addicts themselves would have no problem because they wouldn't be building their own liquor store. There would be no place to buy it because they are the only people who buy it. You shouldn't be buying it for the other people. So if you think about it, the weird situation of addicts is that they need to be away from regular people, at least until you know they've got things under control. So if you built a place where it was only addicts, they wouldn't have the problem of dealing with regular people and their liquor stores. Now you might also build communities for families or seniors or singles. You know, there might be a variety of ways to do it. Maybe some mixed use. You could see some situations where some college age students are living with senior citizens because it's really a good combo. You know, the young person can help them with some stuff. The old person has a nice house, but it's sort of empty. So we're already seeing that's a trend. Maybe you could build a community with that taking into consideration. 

All right, so here's the bottom line. Everything about our legacy lifestyle from school to how we live, how we eat, everything is now under question. And I think that people are gonna get real serious about designing from scratch. And if you can, you can imagine the magnitude of this kind of a change because the thing that we don't get right with housing is we don't really build it for the person. Well, let me show you what I'm talking about. 

**The Golden Age is going to come because we have super low interest rates, which is really good for construction. All of our assumptions about how we live has changed because of the coronavirus. There's this entrepreneurial, gigantic wave that's coming largely because everybody had to rethink all their assumptions. And suddenly they said, maybe working for that old boss that just fired me is not a safe job anymore. So I think you're going to see just a huge wave of entrepreneurial action. But most importantly, I think we're gonna learn that our happiness, as creatures in this universe, depends very much on programming our bodies and our brains with our environment.**

And what I mean by that is, if you build a low cost situation, which is designed well but allows you to get your vitamin D because the need for sunshine is built into it. It allows you to get your quiet time because that allows you to sleep well with darkened rooms that aren't too loud if it allows you to be safe. Let's say it's got really good security if it allows you to be less bothered. Less anxious, less stressed. Every one of these things are things which your physical surroundings can control. They can control you with color and sound. You know, the availability of good food, good nutrition and just the impact as on your wallet. Every one of these things programs you. 

If you want to be happy, you first have to understand that you're being programmed by your environment. And then the second thing you need to do is learn to program your environment. So we have to program in you the part that's missing, and we're so close to unlocking the Golden Age by realizing it. 

So let me say it again. If you're just letting the environment program you, you're just taking it as it comes you just living in somebody else's world, which is what we've been doing. A world that was designed for people in the [1930s] who have long, long since died. But if you want to take part in something amazing, **you have to realize this simple truth about the world. You can change your environment, and if you do it right, it programs you the way you want it.**

That's the interface. Change your environment and then it programs you. The simple example is, let's say you weren't getting enough vitamin D. Yeah, whatever you think that does for you. Science is pretty adamant that that's a big deal. So you build a community where your physical surroundings will just accidentally give it to you. Let's say you know that taking a nice walk in the outdoors every day makes you feel better. (Aside: By the way, if you tried this, a lot of you have been taking walks since the coronavirus started. Have you noticed how much better you feel when you take a long walk, right? I mean, you could really feel the difference.) It's because you've used your external environment to re program yourself internally. Now, once you learn that, that's sort of the key to life changing your externalities to reprogram your yourself, then the golden age is unlocked and you get to go to the next level. So we will be, I believe, in a wave of innovation to reprogram our environment so that when you sit down, you're sitting in the good place. It's not is not giving you germs. It's not making you unhealthy. It's not stressing you. We will figure it out. How to build a civilization that for the first time designed for you. 

That's the old age, my friends. So that's [?] or some other fun stuff. I know you do. So as we're watching, (to chat room: somebody saying UV light? Exactly. You probably would want to puts of UV light into your home of the future. Get those viruses right out of there. That's just one example.) 

So you know how we're not trusting any information about the coronavirus? It seems as though everything you find out turns out to be wrong later. And now there's some question about asymptomatic shedding. Apparently, we don't exactly know that asymptomatic shedding is a real thing. Apparently, we're just kind of sure it might be. Now, that's a pretty big deal. Pretty big deal. Wouldn't be nice to know the other thing that apparently we don't know for sure. And I think I told you the other day Anne Coulter was all over this. So apparently we don't know that that virus came from the Wuhan lab. According to Mike Pompeo recently, I guess he went from really darn sure. 

We got plenty of evidence that virus came from the lab, to we don't really know where it came from. That's a pretty big difference, isn't it from? Yeah. Came from that lab to we have no idea [where virus came from]. No idea. Pretty big difference. 

The Chinese ambassador to Israel, who is newly assigned, was just found dead in his home. How often do Chinese Ambassadors die at home? Does that seem well, sketchy to your eyes. Any part of you that says Chinese ambassador dies a home in Israel, maybe. 

Okay. Um, So I was wondering today how many intelligence agencies were watching me, and yeah, I'm pretty sure the the United States keeps an eye on me on I know of a few others that I'm pretty darn sure keeping an eye on me. But I was wondering what would be the criteria for some intelligence agency in another country to keep an eye on you? Obviously, if you're in politics of the military, that would be obvious. But no. You think that they probably watch at least some people who were not politicians or in the military just because they think, Yeah, there might be something they could learn there. And I'm wondering, how could anybody watch American politics and watch it closely enough so they know who all the players are? If anybody watched me for the last few years, what do you think? They would have intelligence assets watching me by now, just to figure out what the hell I'm doing. And I don't know. I mean, I don't know what the odds of that are. My guess just based on the things I've seen and heard is maybe four own that I know off. But I'm just guessing. 

So Jake Tapper was talking about about President Trump's "unprecedented smear campaign". Was talking about how Don Jr made some kind of a joke on Twitter about pedophilia and Joe Biden. Now, of course, Joe Biden has never been accused of that. Don Jr, you know, immediately said, you should be able to tell it was a joke. So is about any kind of a serious accusation. I know what you think. Any sniffs air, but that's that's different. So those were the two examples where President Trump accused a TV newsperson of possibly murder. I thought because he didn't name who the person was. Jake, didn't I thought to myself, Did Trump accuse a news host person of murder? I and I thought, Oh, yeah, Joe Scarborough? Uh, actually, yeah, he didn't actually say Joe Scarborough may have murdered somebody, but there was this issue of a dead body in the office or something in the past. And, uh, and Trump Trump did suggest that there is maybe a story here even say he didn't say directly that Scarborough was a murderer. 

But so here's what's so funny. Do watch. So, you know, CNN has just been running like one hoax after another for the last four years. I guess you know everything from the fine people hoax to the Russia collusion hoax to the drinking bleach. There's one hoax after another. And then when the Trumps turn it around after four years, The thing we've learned after four years is there is no limit to what you could say about the other team. There's no limit. If you look at what what they've been saying about Trump for four years, you'd have to say, where is the limit? There's no limit. You could just make up anything now. Anything. He works for Putin. Okay. He's spending time with children. All right? Yeah, let's Let's just put that out there. See if anybody believes that. 

So what's hilarious about this is that anybody can complain about the other side making stuff up. We're so past the point where it means anything to complain that somebody is making stuff up because it's just all made up. It's all made up anyway. 

That was fun. And my last page of notes doesn't have anything on it. So there's that. Somebody says Birtherism started it well, did it? Because, I don't know. Somebody says, Enjoy this Tonight. Open did put you in a better mood and and so he says, Joe is not the nominee. It will be Harris and Obama with Obama's vice president. I don't think so. No, I don't think so. Who put Greta on the Corona panel and why? Well, uh, wasn't a CNN's panel and why? It's apparently she's interesting, you know? You know the trick of doing something a little bit wrong? Intentionally. When CNN put Greta Timberg on the Corona virus panel, do you think CNN was just dumb? And they're like, Oh, she's an expert will put her on the panel. Nobody will know the difference. Or do you think they were smart because they knew it was just a little bit wrong and it was going to draw people in? I'm gonna go with smart, all right? 

And obviously, I have plenty of credentials of criticising people when I think they're not in the media, especially. I'm going to say that the Greta thing. If if I'm being consistent with my ongoing theme, which is I will separate the technique from whether it's morally or ethically appropriate. Because that's your decision. Yeah. I'm not gonna tell you. It's morally or ethically appropriate. Who am I? I'm not your pope. So you could work on the moral, ethical stuff yourself. Doesn't mean I'm ignoring them. It just means that I'll make my decision. You make your decision on that. But if we're just talking about if a technique was a good technique [?]. But Greta Thornburg on the panel where it doesn't quite make sense why she is there. And the answer is yeah, absolutely. Don't you think that she got more eyeballs because of that? I'm sure she did. I'm sure they did. So I would I would call that a success. You know, I'm not I'm not gonna mock CNN every time they do something that works. If it works, it works. Somebody says it's only a little bit wrong. Well, yeah, I think, actually, I think it is a little bit wrong because let me do something that I know you all hate. I have the same opinion as you do when celebrities weigh in on politics. If they're just a tourist, it's just some celebrity or something. And there's coming in tow, say something and go back to their life. I don't have a lot of respect for that. Although everybody gets to say there they're piece. So I don't disrespect it, just sort of nothing. 

But for those people who actually commit and in Greta's one of those people whose committed, I can disagree with everything she says and still respect it because there's a degree of commitment there that is more important than being right, in my opinion, because, it's a big world. We'll have different opinions. I don't know which ones that right? How do I know if we've just watched a year of all the experts being wrong about everything? So being right maybe is a goal too far, but certainly being interesting matters, getting people to engage on it matters. And I would say that Greta has, earned her place on the panel. I'm gonna say that because no matter what you think about her, anything you never scientific knowledge or anything. No matter what you think of anything, she is committed. She's passionate. She brings an audience. She represents a generation that's gonna be impacted by this. And I think her opinions might actually be newsworthy. 

So, maybe you didn't expect me to go full pro Greta, which is completely different from agreeing on what she wants to do with stuff. But I I absolutely welcome her voice as well as anybody on the other side whose's got an opposing opinion so long as they mean well, and they're passionate, and they're willing to do [?] in public and try to make the world a better place somehow. I know some of you a rubbed the wrong way by her, but there's plenty to like and say. We're just gonna do optimism. All right? Somebody says you lost me. She is a tool. Well, people don't like it when I don't go after people. If you noticed, I don't usually go after people. That's very intentional, because I think going after people is maybe the lowest. It's the lowest level of politics. I'm sure there's something lower than that. But, there are lots of times when you want to go after the person and for me, if the person means well, I won't take that. So if somebody means well and they're putting in the work, I'm good with them every time. So that's my rule. You could have a different rule. 

All right, That's all I got for today. And I will see you in the morning, and we will have more good fun then. I hope you enjoyed it today.
