Hey, everybody. Clinton won in. You found the right place. The best place for the best part of the day. Yeah, Yeah. You know, I don't know how the rest of your day is gonna go, but there's one thing I can guarantee this part of your day. Perfect. It isn't it good to start off the day perfectly. And all you need to keep it going is cover mugger glass. A tanker challenges staying that canteen drug a flask, a vessel of any call you filling with your favorite liquid. I like coffee. And joining me now for the unparallel pleasure. The dopamine hit of the day. The thing that makes everything better. You know, all the things that are all better as soon as you take the simultaneous seven that happens now go Well. How would you like to have your mind blown blown? Here it comes. I asked this question on Twitter just moments ago. Still waiting for the answer. And it looks like this. Here's the mind blowing question. Think of any time in the past there was a presidential election in the United States and the winner Waas. Not any time the winner was not the candidate who looks like he could beat up the other candidate in a fair fight. Physical fight blows your mind, right? Well, let's take a look. Would you imagine in a fair fight that Trump could have beaten Hillary Clinton? Probably right. Would you have imagined that in a fair fight, Reagan could have beat Carter? Yeah, probably probably. Do you think Kennedy could have beaten Nixon in a fair fight? Kind of looks like it about Bill Clinton. Could he beat in Bush Sr in a fair fight? Probably. Yeah. All right. You want you want you want the best one? How about George Bush, the younger and Al Gore? Who would win in a fair fight? Al Gore or George Bush? The younger It would be a tie. It would have to be decided by the Supreme Court. Uh, think about it. Uh oh. Do you think Do you think Romney could be no bomb in a fair fight? I don't know. I think Obama was also a special case. I think the country was ready for Obama. So even if you find the exception, the even the exception might tell you something. Um, I don't think there's anything funnier. They're watching Bill Maher hate the side. He's on because if you've been watching Bill Maher so he's no fan of Trump, and he's no fan of, you know, right wing or conservative ideology. But he also frickin hates the assholes of his own side. Hey, doesn't say it, quite is clearly, is that, but in context, it looks like he just hates being on the side. That's canceling people for just about everything. He was complaining about it last night on his show, and he was talking about the mayor of I don't know, Minneapolis or something. I forget what who he's talking about. He goes, uh, white People need to stop trying to cancel other white people whose heart was in the right place but didn't get it exactly right on the first try. So he's talking about the ridiculousness of his own side, which I could not enjoy more. There's something missing in my room here. That's weird. Well, um, I might have to take a break here. Yes, Well, hello. Don't go anywhere. Don't go anywhere. Most back? No, curiously, and coming back. All right. Um um, so that's funny. Anyway, isn't it weird how the two movies that I call them the left and the right, um I'm gonna characterize them this way. Just cause I think is funny the people on the left to think that the people on the right are a bunch of Racists that basically explains everything, right? There may be unscientific, but mostly mostly the left thinks the right is a bunch of Racists, and that that's just sort of explains everything. But here's the funny thing. The people on the right, they're not aware that they're racist because they probably aren't. They probably aren't meaning that a toll east in terms of their conscious thoughts and their conscious actions, they have no idea what the left is talking about. Now, of course, every group has some races in it, um, over racist. And I'm sure the right and left both have their share. But isn't it weird that the movie that they see you don't know you're in? You're like, huh? Apparently I'm surrounded by Racists. But why don't I ever see it? Why don't we know it? But here's the funny part. What the Ryan sees is that the left is hypnotized by the fake news. Is that not your dominant belief about the left? Now you're also thinking lots of other things you're thinking, Oh, there's foreign influence And you might be thinking, George Soros is giving people money and China's interfering and Russia's colluding. And you're thinking there's lots of stuff going up and you're thinking that maybe the they do the left was, you know, brainwashed in a certain way in college if they went to college. But doesn't it seem as though the breakdown is now the left thinks the writer raises, and the right thinks that the left on Lee believes that because they've been hypnotized, brainwashed essentially by fake news and by, you know, the educational system Is that Is that a fair breakdown? And it's the weirdest thing because you can't even have a conversation with somebody who is hallucinating. So here, by analogy, it would be this would be it would be People are hallucinating that you're, uh I don't know that you're really a aware wolf or something, and you're saying I don't know how to defend myself from the accusation of being aware wolf, because I'm not aware, Wolf, if I were a wearable, I'd have something I could work with. I'd say, you know, we wear wolves are not all that bad. You have to see her good side. Yeah, we got some rough edges, but where Wills, you know, we have our pluses to, For example, we fight vampires. I understand. So I don't know if we've ever had a situation where the two different movies, our ah, hallucination of what the other movie is That's new. Let me give you some positive. The positive, encouraging thoughts about the future. So here's something you're thinking to yourself. Oh, no, there's a slippery slope. These protesters are just gonna destroy more businesses and destroy more public stuff until until it's all gone. What would be a counter force that could make that happen? And it's funny. It's always the same counterforce. There is so much in society that gets we think it's up to us like you. And I think OK, we've got this disagreement. So you and I are gonna work that out, and then you and I fight and the people on your side fight and then I find and that my people fight with your side and you think that's what the fight ISS, only to find out that it's always settled the same way. There's an insurance company somewhere who said, You know, I'm not gonna cover that and that is over. Insurance companies basically run the world. You don't think insurance companies run the world, try to do something that can't get insured, see how that goes. Trying to drive your car without insurance, try to get a mortgage until your bank. You know, I don't think I want insurance on my house. Yeah, I won't be able to pay you back if it burns down or something. But, you know, I think I don't want insurance. No, you don't have a choice. You got to get insurance and that we're watching this. Seattle, You know, the Occupied Zone or the autonomous zone. Whatever they like to call it add because it was a ruling that, apparently, the business owners who have been displaced by the protesters they could actually sue the city. Now, if you could get sued, what's your only protection Insurance insurance? If there's a risk of being sued in the sort of built into your business process, the only way you can protect yourself is insurance. Who is going to ensure a mayor who won't protect their own city? How do you How do you get insurance If you're not even going to try to protect your own essence? Would somebody protect? Would? Would anybody give you insurance for, Let's say, homeowner's insurance? If you insisted on having no doors and windows on your house, you say, Look, I just want a window list. Doorless house. Yeah, any burglar could come and go, and I don't have any security, but I still want insurance. How about some insurance? And the insurance company will say, Sorry, we only give insurance to people, have doors and windows that's up to us. There's no constitutional right to your insurance. It's just risk vengeance so that the hilarious part about the occupation of Seattle is that it will be sorted them by insurance companies. Because in the end, we all have to do with the insurance companies. Tell us to dio now, if that's what it that's one of the biggest red pills in the world when you realize that all of your battles are irrelevant because it's just going to be decided by the insurance company, it doesn't matter what you and I think at, Of course, the insurance company paired with the legal system that makes it expensive to do the wrong thing. Um, all right, Mary Trump has a book coming out. Is that the president's niece? I guess his brother's daughter and I saw a big article on it in The Washington Post was all the headlines and social media, and I was like, Oh, man, it looks like Mary Trump's damning book about the president has just come out. And then I read the headlines, and the book isn't even out. The Washington Post is masturbating so furiously over the possibility of this book being damning that they've already started writing feature articles guessing what's in it? Did I make that up? Nope. They just wrote a feature article in The Washington Post in which they're guessing what kinds of things she might say. Have we reached a whole new level of ridiculousness? And so here's the set up. So Mary Trump. Apparently there was some dispute about her inheritance at some point, so she's mad at the family, so that part seems to be established. She's got a you know, she's got some reason to be angry at the family in general on may be, uh, President Trump in particular. Well, she wrote a book about him. So, yes, it's obvious. But here's the fun part. She's a clinical psychologist. So what? The thing that has the Washington Post salivating and others, I'm sure, is that how good would it be? Finally, it's their Holy Grail. What could they want more than a trained clinical psychologist who has spent a lot of time personally with the president? Right? Because the thing they always lack is when you know somebody goes on TV and they say, I've never met the president but he's clearly schizophrenic, paranoid narcissist. And then somebody will say, Um, remind me about your your professional ethics in this psychiatry business. Are you supposed to diagnose people you've never fucking met? And then they'll say, Well, not normally, but the risks are so high that I thought I'd do it this time. And then you say, uh, we don't want to listen to you any more. If you can't even follow your own journalistic integrity or your own professional integrity, you know? So the story is going to come and go But what half somebody knew him personally in for years had been in the same room. So all of the family dynamics and was a trained clinical psychologist. May I do my impression of Dale finding out that there's a trained clinical psychologist who hates the president and spent a lot of time with him? So when she speaks, he can speak intelligently. Dale, did you hear that news? 00 And seem that was Dale enjoying the news that Mary Williams are married? Trump, uh, as a book of you, Mary Williams and somebody in new years ago And, um, Pupo in my twenties, actually. So Mark Cuban made the smartest political play maybe I've ever seen in my whole life. And if you miss that, it's really is one for the ages. Now, if you ask them, I don't think he would admit that this was a strategy. And I'm not sure you could call it a strategy. So let me just let me describe the situation, and then you tell me what you would call us. What I call it is somebody who's good at chess, figuratively speaking, good his strategy good at good at business good and sort of seeing the whole picture. So that's that's more Cuban. And he came out with this tweet. Uh, it was yesterday because he's a Biden supporter. And of course, the obvious question is, uhm Mark Cuban, you seem pretty smart. Why don't you see what were seeing with Joe Biden? That his mental condition is not say 100%? And of course, Marquez defended him as being, uh, perfectly capable of doing the job. Uh, and that maybe Trump has some some issues there. But he kind of did the final clever play that I talked about finding free money on the on the ground, and he found this free money that I don't think anybody else would have seen. It was like invisible free money that only he could see. But then, once he sees it and he tells you about it, you go, Oh, my God, Now I can see it and it goes like this he tweets that he would be perfectly OK if randomly selected so that they're not in anybody's pocket. Randomly selected experts could do a psychological evaluation on both Biden enter up. Think about that now. If you weren't thinking strategically or any other way, you'd say, Oh, that's just a tweet. It's just a tweet supporting his person. Yeah, you know, Biden will take a test if Trump takes the test. If you see them, the surfaces, there's not much there. Right? But thank you through thank you through now. In all likelihood, that will never happen. Right. But by raising the question of Biden and a psychological test, you kind of think it might be more likely to happen, don't you? And wouldn't you actually like to see a psychological evaluation by independent people of both Biden and job? When you I would I would like to see that. And and let me tell you, I don't care where the where it comes out. If it came out, the Biden was perfectly, perfectly capable. And Trump was not According to actually experts that I found credible. I would take that to mean something. I would take that to mean something like that would influence my opinion. And it should influence yours if you say it. Wouldn't you know, maybe because you don't trust the experts, but let's say hypothetically you did. Wouldn't that change your mind now I don't think it would come out that way. I think Trump would do pretty well. I think Biden would have some problems. But what if I'm wrong? Right where none of us are so smart that you could be sure about any of this stuff because we can be easily fooled by confirmation bias and, you know, just rooting for your team, etcetera. So by Mark Cuban just putting it out there. How about testing both of them? Because I don't know. Anybody said that before, and it's very provocative and because it's him, people pay attention because it's Mark Cuban. So so now that's out there, that here's the brilliant part. Suppose that happened. I suppose it happened now. You would expect that Biden might have some issues, and it might be a factor in him being changed out before the election. Wouldn't you say that's reasonable? A lot of people are talking about the possibility the Biden will be switched out close to Election Day, so that's not really a big, surprising thing. It's possible, but here's the other part that's really fun, more Cuban, just by being in the public and talking about these things, his profile in his name are being associated with the run for the presidency. At the same time, he's spending nothing campaigning. Nothing. Mark Cuban is not running for president officially, and he spent nothing campaigning for president. Running for president is really expensive. Hundreds of millions of dollars. If you happen to be a billionaire, he spent nothing. And I would say that with that would move just by you saying, Hey, let's test them both. He put himself in the top five of potential replacements for Biden. Does remember he's pro Biden, so he doesn't have a negative connotation on the left. And if you were to pick one person in the world who could actually reliably, I think beat Trump probably be him because he could pick up Republican votes. You could pick up Independence and the people on the left would just say, We don't care. It's just not Trump. All right, C. So Democrats would just be automatic because they say you're not Trump. Can you confirm your name is not Donald Trump? All right, we're on your team, so it doesn't matter what the Democrats like they're still going to vote for, because I don't think he has anything negative that would. You're getting canceled by the left. Yeah, of course. When he was a young man, he had some fun that all that stuff comes up, nobody cares. Nobody cares what you did 20 years ago. Frankly, the same with Trump. Um, now. So here's the thing. So the correct question is Would comma would not be the more likely choice if by didn't faltered or were replaced before Election Day and I would say she would be, Yes, Camilla would be the first choice, But I think Cubans in the top five, isn't it. Just think about it. Some, he says Cuban can't run, and I don't know if that's true. Is that a question about being on the on the ballot? This is a question about being on the ballot. So if that's the case, well, that would be interesting. But what happens if the Democrats candidate drops out before Election Day? Does that mean there's nobody who could run because I don't know that Kamala Harris? No, I guess How would that work? Let's say, um, somebody answer this question for me now. If Kabul Harris, uh, became the replacement for Biden before Election Day since she had previously announced and she was gonna run for president. Maybe the paperwork's all down so that she didn't have any paperwork Problem. Is that true? I don't know if that's true, but what about let's say they picked a mayor? Let's say Biden picks a mayor for his vice president. Biden is replaced. Could the mayor, who had not already long ago filled out the paperwork to run for the top spot? Is it too late? Is it too late? I don't know. So that's the question, Uh, somebody who knows what they're talking about, which would not be me. Find out if somebody could run for president at the last minute, as long as the Democrats wanted that to be their candidate. So let me know how that works. Um, yeah, And I know that the delegates, the delegates might want Bernie etcetera. And so I'm not saying that, um I'm not saying we know for sure who the person would. I'm saying. The Cuban put himself in the top five for the conversation, at least the possibility using the top five to be a replacement for Biden. And he hasn't spent a penny. That's all I'm saying. So on a risk management level, this is so smart is just one of the best place I've ever seen. Now it probably won't pay off, because the he just would be one of five people considered. Biden still has to actually drop out blah, blah, blah, So there's a lot that could go wrong. But to put yourself in the top five for a contention without spending a penny this close to Election day, I don't know. Would anybody else have seen that play? That's all I'm saying. Um, I did a Little Twitter poll, which I asked people, if a computer, uh, hold you. In other words, there's no human voice. It's a computer that calls you on your phone and says, Who do you want to vote for? Uh, in the upcoming election? Would you admit that you were gonna vote for Trump if you're a Trump supporter? So that was the question I posed on Twitter. Now it's a Twitter poll, so of course it's not, you know, dependable like a regular poll. But I wanted to see if anybody would say it, cause it could have been, you know, that Trump supporters might say, Screw you, Scott. We're not afraid of saying who we support, so I didn't know how it would come out. So it came out that, uh so 45% of people said they wouldn't answer. So, you know, nearly half of the people in my unscientific Twitter poll said that if they were contacted by an actual scientific poll that they wouldn't answer now 45% of people wouldn't answer. Yeah, you've got trouble collecting. Ah, good enough, sample. But you could still do it. Still do it. Um, but suppose so if those who answered, uh, they add up Teoh 55%. Duh. So of the 55% who would give an answer. Um, now, these are the percentages. I'm sorry. I'm confusing you with the percentages, So let me just give it to you straight. 45% said they wouldn't answer it all. 37% said yes. They'd say they were gonna vote for Trump. And remember, these are only people answering this poll who already said they would vote for Trump. So 37% said they would admit it. Only 37% would admit it to a computer. They're not even talking to a real person. They're talking to a computer, and only 37% of the people who follow me on Twitter who are also Trump supporters who also insert answer this poll said that they would admit and 18% in my little unscientific poll said that they would lie and say Biden remember the 18% is only 18% of the total people, but only 37% said they would say Trump in 18%. Would also answer said there was a Biden, so you should really look at 18 being half of 37 roughly So, uh, roughly, uh, let me do my math better here. Roughly 1/3 of the people who would answer would lie 1/3. Can you believe that? 1/3 of the people in by unscientific so you shouldn't take this too seriously, Bull said. They were lie and actually say by No, be careful because I have primed my twitter. My twitter following is not like any other generic group of people. There are pretty self selected and they've been primed for this prank, so it would be higher number in my presumably in my group. But let me ask you this as unscientific as this WAAS deeply, deeply biased and unscientific, does it not? Still, does it not still show you that there's a fairly massive problem with people being honest on these polls? I feel a Zeph. It's indicating there's a problem like a bigger problem that every before and let me put it in starker terms, I don't think in 2020 it would be smart to answer a poll honestly, if you were a Trump supporter, because there might be a day keep this in mind if the Democrats win, they've said they've said directly that they're coming after Trump supporters. Have you not heard that? Have you not heard people on the left the team that could win, that they would actually come after supporters, And there would be, in theory, some database. Even though a computer made the call somewhere, there's a database of this phone number had these responses so you could kind of piece it together. Would you want to be unlisted when you knew people were gonna be using the list to hunt you down and make you pay now? Probably that will happen, but it feels kind of scary. And people, people respond to the risk as much as they respond to reality. So I was thinking that the worst was behind us in terms of the economy and Corona virus, and maybe even the protests were losing a little steam. And I was thinking, you know, finally, are we getting past 2020 has been pretty rough. I feel like we're behind it. And then I saw a headline that says, Tennessee police warn of flushing drugs that could create hyper aggressive alligators. So, apparently, if you flush your meth down the toilet, um, it can get into the water supply and then you're alligators will be on meth, and we'll be living in a world with hyper aggressive meth alligators. Now, you might say to yourself, I don't want to live in any kind of a world with hyper aggressive, meth soaked alligators. That doesn't sound good, but, you know, I don't like to admit this. I don't like to say this in public, but I'm gonna do it anyway. If we don't get any hyper aggressive alligators, I'm gonna be a little disappointed. No proud of that. I'm not proud of that. But if we got no hyper aggressive alligators, none not a single hyper aggressive alligator. I don't know if I'd be OK with that. We live in a world where, damn it. I need some hyper aggressive meth meth up alligators because I don't know about you, but it's getting harder and harder to watch the regular news. The political news. If I watch one more black man being killed by police on video, I think I'm gonna shoot myself. But I could definitely watch the news about some hyper aggressive meth alligators. I could watch that all day long. There is a new story and of Down in Florida, hyper aggressive alligators have attacked Main Street. Four fatalities. Now, I'd say to myself, Nobody's happy about fatalities. Can't be happy about that. I feel sorry for the families, but I could watch a few more of these stories about hyper aggressive alligators. A lot of good person, apparently. Apparently, there's something deeply wrong with me, but I could just watch more hyper aggressive alligators, that's all. I'm just all I'm saying, um, you know, I've told you about my game that I play when I see a name trending on Twitter. If you see a celebrity's name, you play the game. Covad canceled her dead. So you say to yourself, Oh, why is this person's name trending? And before you know the answer, before you click out it, you say, All right. Do they have cove it? Are they canceled or are they dead? And so this morning I saw jackpot sabic trending on Twitter and I was like, Oh, no, Poor Jack. What is it? And you know is he is a cove. It is. He canceled. Is he dead? Well, he's still alive, and he's not canceled. These, well, no more cancel than any conservative would be. And we don't know anything about Cove in, But the story is that he attended without a disguise and without any security. He attended the ENT if rally right in the middle of that at Emancipation Memorial. Uh, last night. And as you might imagine, uh, he was recognized. So he was recognized by some, uh, little ant. If I got who well, he was who's well disguised. So imagine they, let's say, a fire hydrant with the red goggles, so just stay as a visual the fire hydrant. It's got It's got a little hat on with the hood and red goggles, and it's yelling at Jack Pacific, who towers above it in height. But the little fireeye generals right around where are getting in Jack's face, and it looked like I don't look like maybe somebody threw water. Adam, and they're all crowding around, getting in him, and there's lots of video of it. It is really fun to watch, because I don't think you've ever seen anybody in so much physical danger who didn't seem to be bothered by it. So you have to watch this thing. It's it's kind of fun to watch because he's surrounded by really angry and violent people who any moment are getting ready toe. You attack him and then the right in his face, and they're all over him and there jostling him. And it's just it is just sort of looking at him like right, all right, who's next? And, uh, he gets he gets escorted out, made news. I don't believe any other national reporter got anywhere near the center of the of the thing, but, you know, there were a lot of cameras watching the entire event. So you get awesome views from different places, and it looks like it looks like Jack was willing to take one for the team, if you know what I mean. It looks like he was willing to take the punch. Now, I don't think he was asking for a punch, because that looks different. You've seen you've seen the anti five. People were just asking to get punched, you know, they're getting in the cops, faces and stuff. It was nothing like that. He was simply asserting his right to stand there in public. Think about it. Just think about that, Jack fisa. Beck is trending today. Just think about this. This is like a pretty massive thought. He is trending on Twitter and he's a national story because he had the temerity to simply stand there in a public place and just and just have a different opinion than the other people were there. That's it. He wasn't assaulting anybody, wasn't He? Wasn't I wasn't doing anything offensive whatsoever. He was simply asserting his right. Obviously, I don't know what he was thinking internally, but in terms of, you know, physically, what was happening as an observer's perspective, not his internal thoughts, which are only his own. Um, he asserted his right for a lot of the people who were watching this. He went right into the middle of it and asserted his right to be there in a public place peacefully. Now, if he had been punched with the conversation have changed. I think it might have. I think it might have. So, um, I really appreciate it, Um, what Jack did because I think, you know, all of us have to sort of make sure that we're pushing the envelope a little bit because otherwise the walls, we're gonna close in, as the Left likes to say, and they would like to squeeze any trump supporting or conservative opinions into nothingness. And the only way that that doesn't happen is that there's some people who are willing to risk taking a punch. If you don't go that far, the wall will just keep closing in. So yesterday, Jack took a stand for freedom. I would say again, who knows what is internal? The thought process was, but in terms of what it meant to me, what it meant to me is that you stood there and said, All right, we've reached We've reached the point where you either have to punch me or shut the fuck up cause that's where we are now, right? You throw the punch because there are a lot of people were gonna watch this punch if it happens now. To their credit, the protesters did not throw any kind of a let's say, a hospitalization kind of a punch. But there was enough of an assault. Collectively, there was enough of an assault that I guess the police have been informed and there may be some illegal action which would be completely appropriate. Now, let me ask you this If there's a civil lawsuit which I imagine there could be a I don't know that there will be, but there could be a And let's say that that, um, fireplug with the red goggles is identified. Um, already on Twitter, you can see his name and picture, but I would not say that's necessarily the right guy yet, so I would caution you that although he has the assailant work, alleged assailant has been identified on Twitter. Give that a couple of days. You don't want to get a false false identification. So just give that a couple of days to make sure that we're talking about the right person. But suppose he got sued? Uh, lost. Does that guy ever get insurance again? Who would ever give insurance to the fireplug with glasses? I don't know. I'm not sure if insurance matters in his case, but yes, that's going on. All right, So, um, I have been trying also to stretch my boundaries of free speech. And I said, There's this weird thing going on where some of us are actually slightly getting mawr free speech at the moment because of the weirdness of things. So while most of you are getting less free speech, you know, if you if you stick your head up, you're gonna get canceled and that's that's a real risk. And I don't recommend you do it. If you are a civilian, let me say that again. If you're a civilian, meaning you're not in it professionally, and you're not doing this in public the way I am, I would consider myself a professional in this context. But if you're not a professional, you might want to keep your head down. You might want to keep your head down because it's not safe for you. But there are some few of us who are professionals who are actually weirdly giving a little extra space. And the reason we're getting a little extra spaces that people don't want to engage with us because the experts air too dangerous. It would be too hard to cancel me at this point because I'm too vocal and I don't think people want to hear what I have to say. But let me give you some examples of where I'm scratching my rights of free speech. So a couple of days ago, I did this tweet, which I already told you about, but I want to just give you an update on it. I said that quote white privilege is a racist term. In my opinion, anyone who uses it is either racist on media or an asshole. But then I went on to say that rich privilege is a thing, obviously now that got, um, close to 10,000 retweets. All right, so if you get that many retweets, it means that a lot of people not only agree with that. In fact, there were almost 28,000 likes now for my account. That's about 10 times more than a than a viral tweet. So based on the size of my Twitter account, if I get 1000 retweets on a tweet, I consider that when one of the bigger ones yeah, that's 1000 for me is a lot. Rarely, although lately has happened. Mawr. I'll break 2000 but it's rare. This tweet had almost 10,000 retweets, so that means it is massively agreeable to people there. They're putting themselves behind it. And I actually said that white privileges and racist term, 10,000 people retweeted that So this clearly, people are not only agreeing with it, but they're willing to say it in public. All right, the willing to say it in public is the interesting part. Uh, and I didn't get canceled for that because, uh, and simply because it's obvious that white privilege as the term is a racist term, if you actually get into the conversation, it's gonna go my way because it's a racist term. It's not even a hard argument to make right, Um, which has nothing to do with whether you know African American people are discriminated against. And there's legacy of slavery and all that has nothing to do with those questions just by itself. Wipe religious, obviously racist term. It minimizes weight people. Um, so that didn't get me canceled. So I thought, Well, I'm gonna have to push this a little bit further. So yesterday I tweeted this and said, If I ever find a baby trapped at the bottom of a dry well, I'm not going to help until I know whether or not the legacy of slavery had a role in it. If yes, I'll help if it's just unlucky, white baby. It's on its own. And I said, by doing this right now, you can see what I've done is I've simply taken the point of view of black lives. Matter have taken the point of view that if if you had a legacy of slavery, that's a special condition which generates, in their view of the world, special privileges and or payments reparations and or, um, accommodations may be that are a compensation for that, that evil in that wrongness now nobody, of course, disagrees that slavery was the ultimate sin. You know, the ultimate evil. You know that Maybe the Holocaust was worse, but it's still in that category of ultimate evil. Um, so everybody agrees on that. And here's the thing. It doesn't make a lick of sense. So it's the most dominant agreed upon thing. Even by both sides, I would say both the right and left or both under the opinion that slavery had a ripple effect. Of course it did. How could it not really had a ripple effect through time and that it affects people today? But here's the thing that nobody wants to say out loud. Who fucking cares? Why does that matter? Now when I say Who cares? Let me be very clear. I do care about the people. Of course, black lives matter, of course. So I care about all people. But that's my point. I'm left of this. Do you get that? I'm left of the left on this black lives. Matter says we need to do something about people who were the laissez victims of slavery as it rippled through the generations. And I say, How about we extend that? How about we say that you're not left enough? How about I say there's something very selfish about that because you're excluding, let's say, for example, a Filipino American who's not doing well. You're excluding, for example, uh, an Hispanic American who is just not doing well. It's not their fault they were born into a bad circumstance. You're excluding a Chinese American again. I'm just using these phrases as they're all Americans. So in my example, the role Americans one way or another. But why? Why do they not get help? Because they have a different reason that they're in bad shape. Does the baby have a
