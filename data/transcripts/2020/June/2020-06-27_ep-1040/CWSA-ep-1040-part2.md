raises as they're all Americans, In my example, the role Americans, one way or another. But why? Why do they not get help? Because they have a different reason that they're in bad shape. Does the baby have any responsibility for what the parents did that got the baby in this poverty situation? No. No. So if you're trying to carve out a special class of victim, there is no rational, logical or moral support for it. And we've all just swallowed this big fat fuckin lie because we've been beaten into submission because we know we will be cancelled if we push back. All right, black lives. Matter is way too far, right? For me. Way too far, right? Because left of them is you help. Everybody is in trouble. Left of black lives. Matters where I am. Remember I told you I'm left to Bernie. Well, I'm probably not left to Bernie of this one. If Bernie thinks that only poor black people need help because of their circumstances, I will eat my chair. I will eat my chair. If Bernie Sanders doesn't say some version of what I'm saying, which is no black lives matter your issues are 100% valid. There are lots of people who need help or black and their reasons. We can identify which are certainly factors. Nothing. They're not the only factors, but they're factors. But are you telling me the Hispanic kid who didn't do anything wrong was just born into a bad situation? That's that they were just born into a bad situation and you're not gonna give them any help? How is that, right? So how'd I do on this? Tweet? So this one got 388 retweets 388 compared to the other one which I thought was about about white privilege being racist, which got 10,000 retweets. So they are both pushing, pushing the envelope of what I'm allowed to say without getting canceled. But one of them only got 388 retweets and the other one got 10,000. What it tells you is that the one who only got 388 Tweety retweets is too dangerous. It was actually safer to say that white privilege is a racist term. Apparently that it was safe to say that all babies were in bad shape should be helped. Think about that. Think about the fact that people are afraid to say you should help a baby regardless of how it got in trouble. It's amazing. I mean, it's amazing. So I think that tells you that sort of the the edge of where people are comfortable with their freedom of speech. But not may. I'm gonna push a little further as I did yesterday. I want to hear what I did yesterday, and I'm gonna extend it a little bit. Today I made the following tweet, which is eight points that I claim everyone and follows these steps to success does well now when you make a public statement like everyone, for the benefit of people were very particular independent. It never means everyone. So if he ever if you ever hear me use the word everyone does this just in your head. Translated Teoh. He means most of the time or it's generally that way. It never means everyone, okay, but I say it to be provocative. Everyone who follows these steps to success does well. It's a list of these steps. See, if you agree. Number one focus on useful education. I put in useful if I didn't find an educational path that by its nature is useful. So maybe not Be art historian, for example, maybe be a mechanic, so it doesn't have to be regular school. Just useful education Number two. Stay an illegal trouble Number three. Stay away from drugs Number four. Don't become apparent too soon. Everybody knows what too soon is right before your economically beset number five Bill the talent stack. So put together talents that make you useful. Number six Be useful to others. And this has to do with reciprocity. If you are seen as being useful to other people in a variety of ways, everybody wants to be with you. They want to marry you. They want to be your friend. They want to hire you. They want to buy your goods so being useful to others in an overt way. Amazingly powerful for success, Number seven favors systems over goals. You all know what I'm talking about, right? It's not good enough to have a goal. You need a you need systems that can get you ready for a variety of goals. I right about that. My book kind of failed almost everything is so winding. Number eight learned the basics of risk management. And here I mean, learned that diversifying your stock portfolio makes more sense than by one stock. Learn that you might have to try 10 start ups before one of them works. Learned that if you're making investment with other people's money, it's better than using your own very basic things. Yet people don't know them until they're taught. So there are a lot of basic things about risk management that people don't know that it's easy to imagine. Well, wouldn't they know that Just common sense? And the answer is no. No diversification as a concept is in common sense until you hear it the first time. And then you say, OK, I get that. So it's not hard stuff. So here's my provocative thought of the day. If you want a measure racism, I would say that the only way to measure it or the best way you can't really ever be sure you're measuring it perfectly would be to compare the people who follow the eight steps in different groups. So rather than saying, you know, just all the people look the same who were in this group compared to the people some visual way, you know, they're there. Melon in this the same of year that had a comparison. Just feels useless all the time. To me, it just feels like somebody's trying to cause trouble when they compare people unjust. Well, these air black and these air white how they do it feels like you're just asking for trouble. How about if you compared the people who used the same strategy? Because I think everything on this list is available to everybody. You know, everybody could have a useful education. Now, I know it's gonna be harder in, You know, if your school systems of mass etcetera. But there are you, Um, I think that when laissez colleges look at that, they actually factor it. I think they take into consideration that you were from a bad school. But let's say you're an African American student, so they're going to say, Well, you know, I think we're gonna give this person a chance. So I think everybody could get an education. And if they can't, Well, that's what you fix. That's where you focus. So I'd like to see the incomes of the people who did all the right steps compared to the other people in any other group. You know, white, Asian, whatever. Who also did all these steps. If you compare the people who use the right strategies to each other than what's left might indeed be racism, and it could be a big deal. And I'd like to know what that is because if if that still exists for people who do everything right, would you like to know that? I mean, seriously, Wouldn't you like to know, um, that that everybody who did the right steps did. Well, now I see some provocative people here and asking about, like you and I know what you're gonna say. You're gonna say, Hey, isn't it just that I Q is predictive, and the answer is not really in the way that you think it's a popular thing on the right to say, Well, isn't it just all like you and you know, And the answer is not really because I Q is highly, um, influence a ble, for example. Did you know that I cues have been have been going up for decades? Well, how is that possible? How could I Q's go up for decades. If I Q is just sort of baked into your DNA, it's not like we're evolving. Are we evolving that quickly? I don't think so. So there is something about the environment that operates with whatever your natural capability is that is very important. So I don't think Let me extend this further. I've said to you that you should think of your brain to include your body, because when I let's say when I'm cycling through ideas for jokes, for example, I feel them in my body like I laugh or whatever, and that's part of my mental process. So I think of my brain and my body has one unit. Likewise, I think you could extend that that your brain and your body and your physical surroundings are all part of your brain or your I Q. If you will. For example, if you spend time in dirty, dingy, poorly lighted areas, how good is your brain? You've probably experiences right? You go to a well lit, happy, bright place where there's no trouble and no, no physical risk, nothing to worry about. How well does your brain operate? Pretty well, you got it you don't have a problem in the world. I got light. I feel good. I've had a good meal, my brains. Good. Now take you five minutes later. My dog is sleep barking. If years weird sense of their now take you same person and put you in a just a really bad environment. It's depressing. It's scary. You've got anxiety. You've got stress. How does your brain work? Is it good? Just a good is when you were in the other situation now because used to think of your brain and your body and your physical surroundings as you're thinking machine. Those are not the same machines. Somebody says None sense about light and neatness. Whoever says that. That's nonsense. You've never had a creative job. I can tell anybody who has a creative job will tell you. I think 100% of us will agree that your physical surroundings and how you manage your physical surroundings just completely change your attitude. Yesterday I was having a bad day. Uh, and I was just so depressed on my energy was just in the basement. I couldn't even work out. I just I just wasn't happy and I said to myself. How long have I been in this dark house? Because I don't have good light. My owes. I thought what would happen if I just got on my bike and took a ride? I walk outside into my garage, Get on my bike, pull it out of the garage. The light hits May and my my attitude change like that. My entire mental structure just went boom to complete happiness in five seconds of changing my environment. It was actually that quick and I and I realized at the time. So here's what I'm saying. Um, I don't think that I Q is as accurate as you think. But here's my other provocative example. For those of you who are watching, let's say there are two groups. This piece of paper represents, uh, anyone group. Let's say they're left handed El Bony ins and the bottom of the paper is the lowest i Q of any of them. And then here's the highest, like you of any of them at the top of the paper. Then there. Then they're being compared to lis, a right handed El Bony ins. So well, imagine they're such people and the right handed Albanians have a few more geniuses. Here's a piece of paper held up so you could see the one is a little bit higher than the other. But not much to 3% let's say 2%. So 2% more geniuses and maybe 2% fewer people who need Yeah, let's a long term mental health care. But if you look at these two pieces of paper, even though is that there's a real difference between the left ended Albanians and right handed, almost all the people who have regular jobs are the same. In other words, the only difference is there at the top and the bottom. Now the people at the bottom are all the people who can't hold jobs in the first place. Did you compare those to the rest of people? You know, if some people are literally mentally handicapped, are you just throwing them in the mix and say, Oh, yeah, throw them in? That doesn't make sense. You can't count them. That's a special category. And what about the the geniuses at the top? I have bad news for you. You're not one of them. Yeah, you know what? Neither My so What does it mean to you that there exists in one group at the at the very top? Some really smart geniuses and the other group doesn't have as many of them in that category. What does that mean to you? Nothing. Nothing. You're not in that category. It's such a small group of people there. Literally irrelevant anything. You could just throw that group out of the any. Any conversation, because they're freaks. They're freaks. The people who are in that top like crazy 1% who invent everything that matters. They're not you. What are you gonna take credit for that? Because you're you're have something Deana in common. How does that help you invent stuff? Nothing doesn't help you a bit. So the fact that there is some statistical difference between two groups is so close to irrelevant that I don't think it belongs in the conversation. It just doesn't You know, the fact that you might, luckily be in a group that has a few extra geniuses? If if if you're not one of them, it doesn't matter. Doesn't help you a bit. All right. Um, here's something that should get me canceled. Let's talk about black privilege. My canceled yet. Can you hear me? Are you still there? Yes. I'm gonna talk about black privilege. The things that black people can enjoy now, obviously, there are huge disadvantages. The black lives matter. People will give you a list. You've all heard the list. I do not question anything on their list. So it's not about that. I'm just saying. Shouldn't we have a complete picture? Is there anything wrong with that? Have a complete picture. So we'll see how far I could move the envelope here because I'm not going to say anything offensive nor anything that anybody disagrees with, I think. And I think you'll agree that this belongs in that there's a really useful reason to include this. All right, here's some black advantages. Do black people have advantages in college admissions? I think the answer is yes, right now, unless that's changed. But my understanding is that black people have an advantage in college admissions. What about college scholarships? Would you have an advantage if you're poor and black versus poor and anything else? And I think the answer is yes. Right now again. Please Fact. Check this. If any of this is wrong. It's not. I'm not saying it with any bad intentions, you know? And wait for my point before before you comment. How about this? Do black people have an advantage in getting a job at a big corporation? So, big corporation, that would have diversity, um, preferences. If you were a black candidate and you have, you know, the qualifications and there are lots of other candidates. Do you have an advantage that works for you? And the answer is yes. It's a big one. It's like, really big. It's like, guaranteed you're going to get the job big. It's not a statistically well, you've got a 2% of greater chance. No, you got the job. If you don't know that, I'm glad I could tell you. So if you're black and you're watching this periscope, did you not know that that if you work hard and in your in your school, the your odds of getting into college or basically 100% you know, as long as you've got good, good enough grades, 100% and odds of getting a scholarship? If you're poor and black, really, really good odds of getting a job after college at a really good corporation. Let's say an apple of Google Facebook when you know a really good job. Uh, do you have an advantage? Yeah, it's pretty much locked in. If you have the right major, if you have the right major and your black Yeah, you could work at Google if you want to. Yeah, if you want to. But if you have good grades in your white, can you necessarily work at Google? Well, obviously a lot of people do, but not just cause you want to. I mean, you gotta be, you know, in a very small, select group to get a job at a company that's doing that well, so that's avenge. Here's one that you would not expect. But I assert this to be true mentoring if you ask. Now, the FUS part is important part of this mentoring. If you ask Andi, I'll tell you my personal story of discrimination on racism to, uh, to make this point. So because I'm a public figure, uh, and I talk about success, etcetera. I'm often contacted by people who would like advice or mentoring. When I say often, I mean literally every day So every day I'm contacted big people who say, Can we get together? Can I talk to you? Could we have a phone call? Would you answer some questions and center? It's just on ongoing stream of those requests. Now. How many of them come from generic white men? Most of them. Most of them. Maybe 95% of the people who would reach out who don't know me already and just reach out and say, Hey, can I get some help? Some advice. 95% of them white men. Now, why is that? Probably because I'm away, man. Everybody feels more comfortable talking to somebody who's like them. Why would women not reach out for advice from me? Well, maybe they think Ben don't have the right kind of advice. Maybe women just more comfortable talking to the women. They don't want to look like they're interested in use. They don't want to make that kind of, ah contact, who knows? But here's the Here's the net result of it. All right. When a woman contacts me for mentoring, just wants answer to a question pointed in the right direction, that sort of thing or a black man or a woman contacts me from entering. They go right to the top of the top of the pile every time. Now am I discriminating? Is that racist of me? Yes, totally, Completely racist is completely racist. That I prioritize black people who contact me higher than white people now has something to do with the fact that I can feel the unfairness of it. And I'm responding to that right. There's a deep unfairness that white people do have a bit of a monopoly on, sort of just knowing how things work, because there are more of them who have succeeded just as a as a gross number. And if you're in the in the world where people are succeeding, you're just seeing how things work so white. People are just more naturally on average, exposed to good mentoring and advice just by living because they're around other people who have advice and they say, Hey, Bob, give me some advice and it's right there. If you were coming from like, let's say a situation where there's more poverty, where or you're just locked into your own social network and it just isn't, you know it isn't as Let's say deep as you want it today and you want to get some other mentoring from some generic white people such as myself. If you contact May and you're you're black, you go right to the top of the list. Now, I don't normally admit this, but in in the interest of deepening the conversation all admitted to you now I absolutely discriminate in favor of black people. Always have always have is that this isn't something new. I just want to told you before, same with women. If women contact me more likely to give them advice. Same reason. Um, no, on, by the way, I don't defend this. If you're saying to if you're saying to me But Scott, that's inconsistent, because why wouldn't you just give advice to anybody who asked for and the answers? I can't defend it. I don't defend it. I'm suddenly in the comments is saying my the only black person in here you might be you might be. No, actually, you would be surprised that the number of black folks following me on Twitter is really is really going up lately and I hope for the right reasons Um, here's another advantage. All right, so just to put a point on that, if you're black and you don't know this, white people are more likely to help you than they are to help white people. Let me give you the red pill of red pills for for the one black. Okay, I've saved some other. It's another some black emoji hands going up so great to have you here. Um, so let me let me let me say this if you didn't know it, uh, this is a big red fill. You think that white people are are cruel or uncaring or mean or whatever to black people? You're probably right. Here is support. You didn't know white people are terrible to white people. Did you know that? Did you know that white people are absolutely terrible to other white people all the time? Of course we need a reason. I mean, if you do something that makes me want to treat you terrible, I'll do that. How about if there's a choice between something good happens for you and something good happens for me? Well, I might choose me because you're all allowed to do that. Looking at looking at all the all of my black followers were waiting, and that's really good to see that it's good to see it. All right, um, so here's another advantage of being black free speech. You don't argue you. There's no way you're going to argue with me on this. Black people have free speech in this country. Why people do not. I don't want to hear any argument on that. If you don't know that's true. I mean, really know that's true. You haven't been paying attention for a long time. Black people have freedom of speech, and I'm happy for him. I would say women have freedom of speech in general, but white men know so much, not so much. We don't have freedom of speech. Um, not completely. And then, of course, there's always that the weapon, which is, if you're black or you're a woman, you always have a weapon to use against white men, which is any accusation, because accusations were all taken seriously and on the accusation alone or the risk of it is a weapon. So even if you have no intention of being that kind of person and you say to yourself, Yeah, I know I could use that if I if I wanted to, but that's that's not my deal. I'm about just earning my own stuff. I'm not about trying to use some weird legal thing just cause I could get away with it. But the fact that it just exists as a weapon does modify other people's behavior, believe me, So those give you a little extra that you might not be aware of now? That said, And let me book bookend this by saying, I'm not. I'm not saying that black people have a better deal than white people in this country. We'll say that. I'm just saying Let's have the full conversation. Let's talk about what's good being white, what's good being black. Is there anything that needs to be done about it? Can we just be honest? Can can can the white public treat black people with the respect for the first time? Maybe for the first time? Because, in my view, treating anybody with respect means you're gonna be honest with them, even if it's a little bit hard to year. If he can't do that, let's not pretend we're showing respect. Respect is you can say what you're thinking, but you don't have bad intentions. And I think one of the reasons I can get away with more than you can and this is a They're pretty important lesson on communication. People will hear what they think you intend to say. They'll never hear what you say. They can only hear what you intend to say, based on their understanding of your intentions and your motivations. I've tried to create a public record that is unambiguous, that I have good intentions. How much would I like black people to be more successful in the United States a lot because it's good for me, too. How is that not good for me, right? Of course. I want everybody who's poor to do better, because if everybody's poor does better, well, then I sell things. There are more people with more money who buy things. How is that not good for me? Of course, I have good intentions. It would be crazy not to, because self interest is the same direction. All right, different topic. Let's talk about Tic Tac, the Chinese government spy app. I call it Hotel Jesus was, uh, tweeting yesterday that he's noticed that IOS 14. I guess that's the new IOS. The beta detects Tic Tac was reading data from user clipboards. And then he goes on and says IOS 14 as a future which notifies users of this kind of behavior. So apparently the operating system is looking for spyware, if you will. And it found something. Tic Tac and TIC TAC says they will stop the practice. Well, tic tac, why did you start the practice? What was that you were doing that made you need to know the data of the users? Clipboard, can you give us any valid reason why that code existed in the first place? So Dick Duck has to go. That can't be in the future That just can't be unhappy in the United States is too dangerous. Um, here's something fun. So I care of the done. Dropped his album, which is, if you're new to this, this will sound like the worst idea in the world when you first hear it. When you actually listen to it, it might feel like the best idea in the world. So keep in mind the how it sounds like just when it's described to you as a concept doesn't sound good at all. But you should see the comments and the reviews that this is getting. So a cure of the Don produced some music in which, um, he he's combined the audio clips from some of my periscopes, I think mostly the one about the user interface for reality. And he uses my voice, and he he does some minor modifications to it just to clean up the audio, and he puts a musical track below it. And I got to tell you, it's really, really good. All right? Yeah, and the indented with Jordan Peterson and he's done it with. I think he did it with an evolved, but he did it with some some other people who have the same characteristic, which is They talk about philosophical things in public now. So Akira has invented this concept, and it is really fresh, like it feels like a new form of art completely, and it's better than the old forms of art. I actually like it better than any any popular music displaying today, so, no, I may be biased because I'm part of it. Um, for full disclosure, I'm not part of it financially So some people ask me, Scott, are you making a profit from this? Because I've been praised against so much? The answer is no, Uh, I'm not. I'm not going to ask for any obviously. Um, so if you want to find it, you would Google my name and the user interface for reality and you look for it on Spotify and Apple music. But there's a fun thing on here, and it's by Akira the Don a k i r A. So if you Google any of those little pop up, you can also see it in my Twitter feed. Here's the fun part. There's a hook on their something that is my voice making a statement that repeats I'm part of it and here's the fun part. It's one of those audio illusions. It's what somebody says. It's just your ego Now. I thought that until I saw the comments, because the first thing obviously would be Oh, it's just because I'm involved. That's why I think it's good. That's the obvious thing that I thought about myself a swell. So I actually asked the Kira what I first heard it. I had to actually ask him or other people having the reaction I am and he confirmed it. And then I Then I checked the comments myself, and yeah, it's people are people are loving it that is objectively true. You can check yourself, um, so there's this one statement that sounded to me like if nobody works and it repeats if nobody works, if nobody works and And I heard it the first time that when I listen to what I thought, you know, that's weird because I don't remember ever saying that sentence it z a unique sentence that I thought, Why? Why is that that I would not remember that and it's clearly me talking. And then I saw the I saw a tweet in which the actual words were in text and it did not say If nobody works. What it did say is it feels like it works now. Do those sound the same to you? I will say both sentences, see how different they are if nobody works compared to it feels like it works. You would never mistake those two sentences and were right. You'd never mistake them. But like the Laurel and Yanni example, the audio thing when I when I didn't know what it was gonna be and I heard it. I heard it as clearly as you could hear a word. If nobody works, listen to it over and over again. It was always the same. Once I read it, I went back and said, How could it sound like that when it really says it feels like it works? So I listen to it again and it's very clearly it feels like it works clear as day. And I said to myself, What What's going on here? And then I did this experiment I played. I repeated in my head the phrase the wrong phrase if nobody works. And then I listened to it again. And it is just as clearly obvious that when I'm repeating the prime ING statement in my head, it sounds exactly like it and that I can change it in real time. I just get okay change the recording in my head, too. It feels like it works, and the audio changes in real time instantly to a completely different sentence. Walling, you're listening to it. Rocky, Freaky. Now I tweeted this, but I made a hypnotist mistake, which made it not work for most of you. I think a few number of people said they also could could hear the phenomenon. But here's what I did wrong. I primed you by giving you the correct one. First, it feels like it works. If you're primed by that, it's hard to get out of it because it's actually the correct one. But if you're primed by the wrong one as I was accidentally, then you can hear both. So if I had set it up right and primed you right, you would hear both. So try that home, all right? I tweeted it if you want to find it in my Twitter feud, Um, let me give you an update on some of the Twitter, um, Twitter business. So you know, that carpet docked? Um, waas, uh, temporarily locked out of his account for DMC A takedown notices, and I have a little more information on that. So DMC a takedown. There's a website you can go to, and you can claim that somebody on some platform is using your copyrighted material without permission. Now, here's the bad part of the process. The process is automatic, meaning that twitter doesn't have a choice if if the DMC a process is followed, even if it's a legitimate even if you just say, uh, my name is Paul McCartney. And unlike them to take my song down, you could make up anything and that the process just doesn't check it. It just says, Well, okay, we got a complaint. So we've got to take this down now. Normally, that would apply to only the material, not the person who put it there, so that would not cause their account to be locked. But apparently Twitter has a three and out rule which Carpet was not aware of, and I have never seen either. I've not seen it in writing. Were any of you aware that if you received three d m. C a takedown notices that your account would be locked? Did you know that? How would you know that? How in the world would you know that? All right now, actually, some people say yes. I don't know if you're resting that question, though, but here's my point. Um, if somebody it makes perfect sense to me that Twitter would block somebody who intentionally used copyrighted material three times in a row, I actually agree with that, don't you? Because if somebody took my let's say they took the Dilbert cartoon and just started publishing it in Twitter every day, well, I might complain once, or I might ask them to stop doing that. You know this first? The first thing you do is just ask. So the first thing I'd do is say, Hey, you know, I'd like people to go to a dilbert dot com because it's advertising supported. Would you mind not putting this on Twitter most of time? That works. If they continued to just publish my cartoon in competition with me by the third time they did it and had it taken down, would I be mad that Twitter said, All right, you're just a bad user, you know? You're not gonna follow, even by the laws of the United States. Maybe you don't below than Twitter. Would I be concerned about that? Not that much, because that's somebody who violated a rule that should be a rule. They did it three times in a row. They're not going to stop. Okay, so But what about carp? A doctor? He produces parodies. A parody is protected a parody could be a matter of opinion, meaning that if it goes to court, you don't really know which way it goes necessarily. So you've got this big gray area where Twitter is being put in the position of being, ah, stand in or a proxy for the for the court because only the court can decide. Did carpet dumped him do something wrong? Do you know? Do you do you know, if he did something wrong if he took somebody else's video? Made an obvious parody by changing it in ways that are clearly parody. Is that against the? Is that against the law? I don't know. Do you know who else doesn't know? Twitter. It's not their job. They're not the court. In fact, nobody knows until it runs in the court system. So there is something very broken about this process. That carpet dunk Timken be taken down just because somebody complained without any without any Uh uh without any less a confirmation that anything was done wrong, right? Don't you have to establish that something was done wrong before your block from Twitter? Especially if being on Twitter is your primary occupation as it is for carp? A. In a sense, um, so I would say that that process is completely broken and that Twitter should get out of the business of being the court. They should just get out of business. If parody is even on the table, they gotta let it go, I say. I say they have to let it go if they need to block the content. That's another conversation, because they might need to block the content until it goes to the court system, but blocking the person, blocking the person who may have Who has. Let's say there's no There's no verified evidence that the person did anything wrong blocking the protesters wrong. Let let me let me state uncanny uncapped ago, Rraklli. That's a Twitter mistake that just needs to be fixed now. I think they are looking at it, actually. So, by my information, is that Twitter is aware of this is being a problem that Twitter needs to fix. So we hope that they dio. But it hasn't happened yet that I know of. Now let's talk about that Rahim Qassim, who also got blocked on Twitter. He had a video that showed the time of death of somebody. So is the moment of death captured on video. And of course, your first thought is Wait a minute. Don't we see that all the time on Twitter? Haven't you seen people at the moment of death like in the last month? A bunch of times. I mean, George Floyd, I mean, all of the George Floyd videos at the moment of death. So why would Rahim Qassim be singled out for having a moment of death video? They just tweeted. It wasn't his video. It was just It was just the tweet. And the answer is that the family had asked it to be removed. So apparently the rule is if the family asked for something to be removed, then Twitter will act on it. In the George Floyd case, the family did not ask because that I think you have a larger political benefit. So they wanted that up there. Um, now, do I disagree that Twitter should take down a video with a showing somebody's death if the family requested? I do not disagree with that. I think that's perfectly, perfectly reasonable rule that they should take that down. But again, why would you block the person. But why would you block the user? Just block the content? The content is the problem. Did do you think that Rahim Cassim, um, wants to hurt somebody's family? I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I haven't read his mind, So I don't know what's in there, but I got to say that blocking people instead of content there's just no way that that that needs to be a long term solution. Oh, but here's a little red pill for you. A lot of people are going to parlor or parlay. I don't know how you pronounce it parlor. Sort of a alternate twitter, if you will. But here, here's what you're going to run into the parlor rules of, uh, their rules for users are going to be the same. It's going to end up very similar. So the trouble is that, uh, did I said I say Qassim instead of Kasab? Did I pronounce his name? Uh, somebody saying I produces neighborhood. Probably did, um, somebody says parlor is a trap. Well, the trouble is that if you go to parlor, you're gonna be all alone with conservatives. What's the point? Did you want a conservative platform. I know you just be talking to yourself. Uh, so I don't think parlor will ever be a competitor in the sense that both points of view are presented because people on the left will just stay with Twitter. Why wouldn't they? And you can't really get ready or Twitter if you're if it has any value to you and all business wise, you can't really get rid of it. You know, I would I would have no intention of ever not being on Twitter. It's too important. Um, but in the long run, parlor is gonna have exactly the same TMC a problems. They're gonna have the same the moment of death problems. It's going to end up being exactly like Twitter in the long run. I think people will figure that. Maybe that exactly, But there's gonna be a lot of the same issues. All right. Um, the thing people would not expect is the If there's any algorithmic stuff going on a twitter or there any human moderators who were being biased in their decisions, you would not have that a parlor. But you'd also be talking to yourself because you're mostly just talking to people agree with you, so I don't know if he gained anything, but, you know, I always appreciate rebels. So anybody who is rebelliously looking at parlor emotionally underside. Um, but I don't know that they're gonna get the benefits they want. All right, Let's see what else we got going. I think that's it. We have talked about everything. Did anybody do any research on whether the president who could beat up the other candidate or the candidate would be beat up? The other candidate usually becomes president. I would like to see that Probably probably only matters from from the television age on word, you know, because if you don't have television, maybe you don't care so much about the physicality of it. And certainly if you go back to you know, anybody in the wheelchair, it doesn't apply. Yeah, basement bite. It is good. Good persuasion. Uh, all right. That's all for now. That will talk to you all tomorrow.
