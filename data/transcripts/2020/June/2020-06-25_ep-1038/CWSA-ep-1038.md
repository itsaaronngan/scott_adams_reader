## Coffe with Scott Adams - ep.1038 - 2020/06/25

I'm bump. Bump, pump, pump. Hey, everybody. Guess what a lot of people ask me. Scott, when will you do the best periscope you will ever do? When does that happen? Today. It's today. Yeah. The best periscope I'll ever do. It's today. And, um, before we start, is there something we do before we get to the good part? Yeah. Yeah, there is. It's called the simultaneous Sip and look at me. I'm back. I've got my notes. I can do it right. All you need is a copper of mugger glass a tanker chalice erstein in the canteen. Jugar flask. A vessel of any guide. Fill it with your favorite liquid. I like coffee. Enjoy me now for the dopamine hit of the day. The thing that makes everything better, including racism, including the pandemic. Pretty much everything it's called. The simultaneous separate happens. Now go. Oh, well, allow me to make your day a little bit better, and it goes like this. Um, many of you have contacted me privately in many cases and said some version of this Scott, I'm afraid the world is or at least the United States is coming apart. Revolutionists coming The Marxist or gaining power. There is a racial strife and everything's bad and we're all gonna die. So version of that And I would like to give you some perspective based on the fact that I am old. Yeah, you would think there would be not that many benefits of being old. What would you be wrong? I gotta tell you the most surprising thing about becoming my age I'm 63 down. The most surprising thing is that while their obvious disadvantages and everybody would know what those are physical, it center, there are way more advantages. Then you would ever imagine I had a time. All right, you just couldn't imagine. And one of the bins that I've been through this before a lot of times. This this thing that looks like it's the end of the world. I've seen this a lot, but if you're younger, you haven't or it or if you just haven't been paying attention to the news until now, you haven't now. Why doesn't seem worse this time? Why does it seem so much worse? 

It's because the media changed its business model from telling you the fax to getting you worked up and getting you worried. So you are part of a system social media, plus the news business, which absolutely, and there's no exaggeration here. Nothing I say should even be slightly hyperbolic. These air facts that established the left agrees. The right agrees. Every researcher, everything I'm going to say he is 100% agreed by everybody, right? There will be no fax, which you say, Well, it's got I'm questioning that part of your assumption you won't The next thing I say you'll agree with completely the business model of social media and of the news is different that he used to bay. It is different in the sense that there intentionally, um there intentionally promoting content that gets you work up. So here's the first thing you need to know if you can just for a moment do this exercise. This is a real thing. Imagine yourself in your body, right Wherever you are, you are yourself all right. You are yourself and how you feel and just feel that, like look around and say All right, this is May I'm in my body in the world now, do this. Take your imagination and a rise out of your body and literally float above it. Just in your mind's eye. See yourself getting smaller and smaller as you get higher and higher and away from the earth. And now that you've got some distance in your mind's eye, you're like a satellite looking down on the earth, and it's just this big ball of nonsense. And now, with a little bit of distance, ask yourself this. Do you think that your opinions about the news, our objective? Or do you think that you have been manipulated by the highest level of science we've ever applied to manipulating the human mind? That's what social media is. It's what the news business becomes by testing and then retesting until they know what works and what doesn't. From the perspective of space, you can look down and you can see yourself, and now you can see yourself as part of that system. And as you see yourself from above objectively now, looking at yourself, you conceal the forces attacking you. Every time you turn on Twitter, look at Facebook, turn on the news and you see all those forces. Now they're almost physical. You could almost see a line from those entities to you and these lines are affecting you. They have to your affected by everything. You're affected by bad news, good news, events, successes, failures. You know you're affected by all of it. And now the most effective, scientifically honed, precise technology is being directed right at your brain. And you can see the lines these lines of influence now in your imagination, their physical Now it's not just, Ah, thought is not invisible Now, Now you can see it. You see yourself, you're small. You see the lines coming in from all the forces. 

They're the ones that are programming you. There's something I've been saying for a while you've heard and you understood. But you didn't really understand it until I took you to space and you got to look down and you can actually see the lines of influence now. And here's the thing that you didn't understand before your opinions are assigned to you. Your opinions are not your own thoughts. Your opinions on the big stuff that the political stuff, your opinions are assigned to you. That wasn't always the case before when the forces of manipulation were weak, we did not at the science to know how to do it so perfectly and so strongly. You had a little bit of freedom because you were not being controlled by external forces and so much. Of course, she always had illegitimate media throughout history. But it wasn't that bigger force. Maybe you didn't even think about these things too much. So here's what you need to know There. There are real problems in the world but have always been the real problems in the world. Now, as enormous as you think they are are actually quite small, by historical perspective, as biggest Aceh's protests across the country Corona virus, the economy. These are real problems, absolutely 100% real problems that are really just this big. There were some of the smallest problems in the history of humankind. You are experiencing the best of times that the media has told you are the worst. Now, when I say the best times, I don't mean that the current few months, which are difficult by any standards, the other there was a real problems, but they're not really problems that are real big compared to what the civilization has handled in the past. Imagine if you will. 

The sixties and young people who were a gigantic part of the population said Revolution. I grew up in a time of revolution when I was young, we wanted to We not me so much. But young people want to overthrow the government. And you had Nixon who was a criminal. You've had Kennedy was assassinated. Maybe by the Mafia. You don't really know. There's never been a time in our history. You know, if you include the civil rights marches, all the violence that came with that these air way, bigger problems way bigger problems in the way you can test this for yourself is look at the way people are talking about them. They're not talking about a solution so much. No, they're talking about it in political terms. That's how you know what? These air not really problems in the way that they're being presented their real problems in the sense that they are problems. They they should be solved. You know, police brutality, etcetera. Real problems. Do you need to be solved? But they're not nearly as big as you think there and by historical perspectives. Kind of easy, kind of easy if I were to, let's say, go to another planet, meet another civilization. And they would say, Hey, tell us about your problems there on Earth. But give us sort of a historical context and say, Well, you know, you got your you got your mass starvation throughout history and the wars and the the nuclear bombs falling on people, World War One, World War two. And then the alien would say, All right, all right. You're scaring me. Those those that really some big problems you say you getting? I haven't gotten started. We got the Korean War than we went to Vietnam for no good reason. We went to Iraq, killed a 1,000,000 people for reasons we don't know. And the alien says, Man, you're getting me depressed. Um, fast forward to the future. Like, is it still that bad? This is still that bad. And now, of course, you've been hypnotized back on earth. So here's how you answer isn't that bad. Are you kidding me? In 2020 is so bad. People are destroying statues, and the Elian says I'm a little confused because you were telling me about world wars and nuclear bombs and and now you're talking about a statue being two faced? Not really the same. Now I know that some of you are saying Scott Scott Scott, how naive are you? Do you not know that this is a clever plan by the Marxist? 

he Marxist are controlling black lives matter the Marxists or controlling anti five and what they're doing, You think it's just some statues stuff? Oh, Scott Scott Scott. What you don't realize is this is step one a necessary plan. It's all been scripted and planned, and it goes like this. First, we will suppress your free speech. Then we will get rid of all your symbols that make you what you think you were. And once we've dismantled all of your symbolism and your hope and your free speech that we move to the next level of control, maybe. Maybe when was the last time something that sounded like that really happened? When was the last time anything that sounded even vaguely like that? You know, I'm talking about right? Just sort of vaguely sort of like that. What? Does that ever really play that? How about never How about never Are you worried about gun confiscation? We just sold the most guns that have ever been sold in the history of humankind in the last three months. Do you know what the biggest conversation among civilians who don't have guns is when they're gonna get their guns? I don't know anybody who doesn't have a gun. Who were the last three months? Didn't say I'm going to get a gun. Nobody. I haven't heard a single person who was gun Liss who didn't say, I'm gonna get me a gun now. Now I'm getting a gun. All right, so we're very bad at predicting where things are going to go. Uh, but the big point is, things were not nearly as bad as you think. Um, here's a little red pill. Fauria tweeted. The only reason we don't treat social media as a national mental health crisis. You would agree, right? Social media has created a national mental health crisis. Is that statement even a little bit controversial? It's not, is it? When you say that science pretty much back set up 100% I don't even think there's any dissent. 

I doubt anybody in left or anybody on the right. Anybody educated anybody and uneducated would disagree with this statement. Social media is a national mental health crisis. But why don't we treat it that way? Do you know why we don't treat it that way? Because the things we think are important and the way we think about that is controlled by social media. Social media tells you not to worry about social media destroying your mental health. Now I don't say that that they don't tell you that what they do is either consciously or unconsciously. It's the effect of the system is that it's not the biggest issue we're talking about. Somebody says Germany, 19 thirties Germany, 19 thirties had so many differences that that analogy is rejected. And by the way, if you have to go to the if you have to go to the Hitler analogy to debunk my point, you've already lost that rule. That rule is 100% solid. If your only argument is a Nazi analogy, you have self immolated. You have lost your argument before you started. All right, um, I was asked on, uh uh on Twitter today to comment on, uh, Joe Biden's decency theme. So I guess you're Biden is sort of branding his campaign as one based on decency in words of that type. And here's my take on that. Nobody wants decency. Decency is the sort of thing you say in public. It's not anything you care about. If you put me put a microphone in my face and you put a camera on me and say, Scott, you're gonna be on national television. Tell us some things you think are important. I'll look right in the camera and I'll say, I think we need to restore decency in America and then you turn the camera off. I go home and Christina says, You know, I've never heard you talk about decency before. Is that like one of your top priorities else? I know I haven't thought about that once in my entire life, not once. If I woke it up and said, You know, decency would be good Somebody is using Hong Kong as an example of you know, the slippery slope. Nope. Hong Kong was doomed on the day that they signed their original agreement with Great Britain to be Hong Kong, because the agreement itself said that it would return to China. Hong Kong never had a chance. 

There's nothing like Hong Kong. Hong Kong had no chance of permanently being independent because the geography and power there wasn't anything that could have stopped that from happening. And while we can, we can not like it. We also can't stop it. So I would say that Joe Biden's decency angle doesn't hit any emotional, um, lever. And so it's It's just sort of dead on arrival. It's the sort of thing you would say if you just don't want toe cause any trouble, Joe, say something that just it's easy toe, understand? And and people will not mock you for it too much because it's just sort of basic. But it won't get anybody excited in any way whatsoever. What would that be with America is going to return to decency. Yeah, right. That's us close to nothing, as as an opinion could be, um, if Joe Biden is serious about returning to decency, you would think he would be speaking a little bit more about destruction of public property, looting and violence in general. But I don't hear that. I don't hear I don't hear him being against decency unless it's directed, of course, as political rivals. Speaking of Joe Biden, um, there's that there was a little news item. Did you catch it? Little small news item yesterday that apparently the smoking gun has been found that used one of the key architects of a coup against the legally elected president, the United States President Trump. Oh, yeah, that's a little bit of news. Now, any news like this is subject to re evaluation and find again. It's all rolling 48 hours later. So I remind you of that. But at the moment, it seems that a Peter Struck memo, um, suggests that Biden was the 1st 1 to float the idea of using the Logan Act against ah, wrongly accused General Flynn. Now it's in the note now, does that mean it's true? Well, you can't know that the note accurately accurately represented the actual meeting. 

So there's always that uncertainty, but you're gonna believe it. I mean, if it's on the note, you're gonna treat it like it was true. And given that we all understand, the Logan Act is transparent bullshit, By the way, I would like to introduce a term today. Um, there are lots of excuses for things and rash nails for things that you might call bullshit. But the Logan act as a means of getting after General Flynn. It might be the bullish, shittiest thing that anybody ever came up with in the world. There is bullshit, and then there's bullshit. And then there's whatever would be the bullish, shittiest thing anybody could ever think of or do, and it would be using. The thoroughly unconstitutional hasn't been tested, but it's clearly unconstitutional. Logan act the idea that an American citizen, especially one who's who's in the incoming administration, can't have a conversation with a member of another country. So whoever came up with the idea of the Logan act as their asses their way out to Flynn is clearly the the person who kicked off the kook when you say I would say that Biden has been identified now as the co conspirator with Obama of the coat. Now will that ever be American history? Let me ask you this. Who writes history? 

Well, you think history is written by the winners, then that's true. And they in the national sense. You know, if a country beats another country in war than the winning country gets to write the history. But what about a history that's disputed within the country? It has nothing to do with another country. Do you think history will show that based on strokes? Note that we could determine that Obama and Biden conspired to use a transparently bogus bull. Shittiest excuse the Logan Act, which, by the way, there's nobody who thinks that's really thing in terms of something that should be or could be. You know, something that somebody would go to jail for and if it's true. And this is also in the handwritten note from Struck that Obama said, Make sure you use the right people. What's that mean? What's it mean when the president says to a subordinate, Make sure you use the right people because if you meant use your best people seems like you would have said that I can't read his mind. I, you know, were deeply involved in mind reading here because it's necessarily important because the intentions of the people are the whole story. If you don't understand their intentions, then you don't understand what happened because things either accidentally happened or it was a coup against the United States elected president there was a big differences, but I can't. 

My brain cannot conceive of why you would use the phrase Use the right people when what you meant. Waas, Use your best people. Do you have to say right people? If you mean you use your 18 use your best people. It doesn't really seem like a phrase you've used. Doesn't know again, Can't read his mind, Can't read his mind But the way this will be received is that we have the smoking gun. It seems now completely clear that Obama and Biden used the power of the government to try to take out a political rival. And in this context, taking him out would be literally a coup against the United States. Now, based on what we know today and again, this could change tomorrow. Right? Could change tomorrow. Tomorrow we might find out. Oh, he writes notes, and he makes stuff up, you know, maybe we find another struck doubt that is so clearly fake that makes this one look less credible. Anything could happen, right? So every conclusion is preliminary in today's world on then. It's also revealed that Comey thought the call with Kislyak Flynn's call with Kislyak was fine. So given these three data points, Biden suggesting the Logan Act Comey saying that the phone call was find in other words, no, no, obviously no crime. And Obama saying, used the right people instead of use highly qualified people or the 18 were the best team. I would say that if you wrote the history of the United States is should say that the Obama Biden administration I'm committed essentially an act of treason under the under the cover of law. So I would call it an act of treason. But under the cover of loss of not technically not technically or his treason, the right word, whatever it is when you overthrow the country, your own country. 

But let me ask you this. Do you think the history books will record that? Because I think that's the truth. And let's say it gets confirmed that everything we've heard is actually what happened. The history books will never write that that will never be your history, and you can watch it. You could watch it in real time because you're alive now. Um, how long will it take for the history of this period to be written. It's sort of being written as your alive. So you get to watch the history books being written now, just to be clear, there will certainly be published books that make the same statements that I just made. But there will be books that don't make that statement or say it's Bs right verbally. But what will we teach in schools? Uh, what will what will high school kids learn? What will college students learn? Will they learn what I just told you? Nope. Not even a slight chance, in my opinion that they will learn that. All right, let's talk about a bubble Wallace, who in my opinion, gets cooler every day. So I have a very positive opinion about Bubble Wallace Onley limited to the few things I know about, so I don't I don't like to endorse anybody's complete anything, does God knows what he'll be. You know what else he's ever done in his life? Who knows if I like that or not, But we know he's very successful athlete. We know he is very charismatic on. We know that he was fooled essentially because somebody very credible told him this noose was hanging there and he believed it. Believing people who are credible is not really a big mistake. 

It was a big impact. But as mistakes go, I mean, that's such a small mistake. I'm not even sure you'd call it a mistake, really. But here's his statement and I told you before he issued a statement about this. I told you what form it should take to be perfect, and I think he hit it so his actual statement is about as perfect as you can as you can play this and it's it's almost identical to what I said should be the forum now. I don't think that anybody listened to me and therefore that's why they did it. This is a fairly standard thing that a good PR, a good PR agency would guide you to this, but it's especially well done. So here's a statement. Let me tell you what's good about it. So he starts off by saying it's been an emotional a few days now, So first of all, he's pacing you because of sort of an emotional few days. You've been feeling it right when you heard it. Maybe you got a little emotional so he's pacing you. Yeah, he's emotional, your emotional good form. So he's pacing. The audience thinks that is First off, first off, first off. All right, he says, First off. So you signaling. Here's the important part. I want to say how relieved I am that the investigation revealed that this wasn't what we feared. It Waas, he wrote. I want to thank my team, NASCAR and the FBI for acted swiftly and treating this as a real threat. So see what he did. He emphasized that the important thing is how people responded because it was so well intentioned and really perfect. You know, I have to compliment NASCAR, so even though NASCAR, you know you could say, made a mistake and you'd be right, because it's obviously a mistake, But they kind of still came out looking pretty good, meaning that NASCAR, um, I thought, presented themselves to the world in a very positive way. But by backing one of their people now, you could argue that there, you know it's being politically correct, etcetera. 

But it didn't really play that way. It played more like sincere people who actually care about this, and they care about their teammates. They care about their sport. And actually, I felt what they did. So I think it was all since here. All right, so here. So then he goes up and here's the magic part of this, Wallace says. I think we'll gladly take a little embarrassment. See how he framed it? He framed his role in it perfectly perfectly. He did not. He did not, um, se I mean, basically, he's just saying, Here's how to frame me Fray Mia's no silly. Basically, he said, I think we'll gladly take a little embarrassment over what the alternatives could have been. Ah, that's so good. That's so good because, um because he frames as these two choices a little embarrassment. Or it could have been this bad thing. Now there is 1/3 choice, right? The third choices. He made some kind of a boneheaded mistake, but the way you framed it was a little embarrassment. That's really good. Really good communication. Really good persuasion, whoever whoever advised him. And this is obviously the work of professionals that you smart as Wallace appears to be, uh, because he looks it looks like a smart guy. Just based on his interviews he can't come up with this. All right? This is not something that an athlete comes up with unless they really You really had some background in this? This is professional work, and it's done well. Um uh, Then he says, Make no mistake, though, some will try. This should not detract from the show of unity we had on Monday and the progress we've made. It is a sport to be more welcoming environment for all. Yes, perfectly done. Congratulations to Bubble Wallace. 

My guess is that his, um despite this, I think that his reputation and brand will come out ahead just because the way he handled it, All right, Apparently, General Flynn conf loot consumed the Department of Justice because his property, if his prosecution is continuing to be shown in bad faith. And it looks like the recent ruling by the appeals court demonstrates that the prosecution was in bad faith, there's enough objective evidence that you can actually sue the Department of Justice to get is six plus $1,000,000 back. How much do you want him to do that? A lot. So if you do All right, um, let's talk about come flu. So the latest little anti trump media is to try to make coming flu sound like a super racist thing. And of course, to make it sound racist, you would have to leave out the following obvious fact. Which, um, I feel I can speak to as a white person so as your as your lists a spokesperson for all white people. I just appointed myself. You don't have to like it, but here's what you need to know. I have never met a white person who thought, Comes Come Food. The actual sport of kung fu was anything but kind of awesome. Uh, have you is ready? Is there any white person who thinks that the actual practice of kung fu is anything but kind of awesome? That's that. It's just a positive thing, like karate. All right. Does anybody have a bad opinion of karate? No. How about judo jujitsu? Do you have any negative feelings about him? No. Nuttall. So what I hear Come food. I just have a positive thought about it and the fact that it's associated with its, you know, its origins and its creation is in Asian countries. Does that make me think less of a country. In fact, I don't know where it came from China and then kung fu. Or do you have the wrong country? Probably that would be typical of me. I am not informed on my kung fu, but given that kung fu is considered nothing but positive literally you couldn't find a negative opinion about come food and this associated with a certain part of the world its origin. Doesn't that also make that kind of a positive thing for where it come from? Came from? So, uh, you can try to turn that into a racist thing, But at the very least, kung fu would have to be a bad thing. To be racist otherwise is just a It's a provocative way to call attention, as the president does to the origin of it. 

So as I pinned my tweet today, I've decided to reclaim free speech. Now, as you've noticed, freedom of speech has been narrowed and narrowed by. What other people are telling you is polite or appropriate to say. And there have always been words that you wanted to stay away from. For example, the n word. I personally find that word offensive and so I don't even like I don't even know how I could get it out of my mouth. It, like it is the worst of all words in the entire English language. I think I can say this safely. It's literally the worst word in the English language. So if you look, if you let's say, roll back the tape to a few years ago and you say, Scott, do you find yourself oppressed because white people can't use the N word? And I would say No, no. Is that a big ask? Is that Is that like, really inconveniencing you that you can't use the worst word in the whole frickin language? The most insulting, demeaning, worst word ever? No, it's no big deal. Now, Does that reduce my freedom of speech? Yes, yes. You know, in a practical sense, in a government legal sense, but in a practical sense, that word and your freedom to use it in place society is effectively removed. But you don't really miss it, right? You don't really miss it so doesn't bother you. But then more more things get added on by the realm of things. You can talk about shrinks and drinks and drinks. And at some point, you have to say to yourself, Ok, that's far enough, you know, because, remember, I always tell you that the slippery slope isn't riel because eventually they will be a counterforce that pops up. Here it is. So I'm one small example of the counter for us. So here's something I tweeted today, which I'm not allowed to say. That's why I pinned it, because I'm going to reclaim that space now. I'm not gonna push all the way back to I need to say the unworthy. There's no other word that could work for me. No, I'm not gonna be a jerk. I haven't. I have no interest in defending people whatsoever. There's nothing. I don't get any advantage from that. Why would I do it? So without wanting to offend anybody and wanting to be helpful, which I always out, I tweeted this white privilege is a racist term. In my opinion, anyone who uses it is either a racist, an idiot or an asshole. But rich privilege is the thing, you know. Obviously, rich people have privilege. 

So So that's my statement. Now, I would say that Yeah, maybe a week ago, I would have been canceled for saying this. And I think only one troll has come after me so far. I swatted him down, but, um, to me personally, the term white privilege and I think a lot of you would have the same effect is nothing but racist. Because what it does is it basically throws poor white people them to the boss. Now, I'm not a poor white person. Not anymore. I used to pay. I used to be a poor white person, but I also added education. So, you know, I wasn't disadvantaged. I had away. I had away toe get money, so just being clear about that. So certainly, being educated is an advantage. Being tall is an advantage. Good looking healthy. Healthy is an advantage where you're born, who your parents are about being a drug addict, not having mental health problems. We have a world full of advantages. If you're gonna pull out my if you're gonna pull out one of them and saying, Oh, this is the special one. That's the bad one. You can't have that special advantage even if you imagine exists. So let me let me be as clear as possible. White privilege is not imaginary, but everybody has a little bit of privilege for different things. There is also black privilege. What would be an example of black privilege? Well, freedom of speech. Black people have freedom of speech in a way that white people simply don't nobody even know. There's. I don't think there's even a black person would disagree with that statement. It is objectively clear the black people have more for you in the speech, so every you know and I don't find myself complaining about it too much like it's, it's just something you notice. But it doesn't really affect your life. Too much to go. Yeah, there are few things you could say that I couldn't say How much does that affect my life? No, no, no. It's no big deal. 

So do I care that told people get paid more because that's established beyond any doubt. Do I care? Yeah, yeah, I care, because that's an advantage I don't have. I wish I did about handsome people, strong people, healthy people, people whose parents were awesome. Yeah, there's a 1,000,000 kinds of advantages picking out this one privilege or one advantage that you're being white doesn't matter if it's true or false. It is just racist, right? It is racist to to talk about white privilege in exactly the way it's racist to talk about. Ah, high crime rate in the black community. Why do white people across the road? If they say if they see it, let's say, uh, 10 black youth. Let's say twentysomethings coming the other direction and you don't know what their delis is that raises. Every group has the room privilege. Um, and let's just acknowledge it. Why not just say there's lots of privileges? Find your find your advantage and talk about that So I no longer acknowledge the category of black problems. They're just problems, Um, on, By the way, add Latimer. I think he, uh, you pushed me over the edge on this deal. Do you all know, add at Latimer on Twitter. So he's African American, but he he doesn't buy into the Let's say he's not drinking all the Kool Aid. So when you see his advice and that's mostly what is his Twitter feed, it's about sort of blunt truth advice from his perspective. First, all his advice is typically brilliant. Some of the best, most most usable, functional wait a frame, your reality that you'll ever see. So it's really important. And and he tweeted the other day, I don't have the exact tweet, but the the essence of it waas that your your problems are special. So this this is ad saying your problems are special and I wish I had the exact quote. But he said something like, Uh uh, no matter what your problem with, no matter what your problem is, there's somebody in the world who has that same fucked up problem and and and fixed it. No matter what your problem is, somebody's had that problem and fixed it. 

Now that's just the most useful way to see the world that you'll ever know, All right, and it's almost that's almost a recording that runs in my head all the time and always has since I was a kid, which is Yeah, you got problems. We're not special, and somebody has had your fucking problem before and they solved it. So about that about maybe you figure out how to solve your problem. So that's my new ah frame on this. I've no longer going to have a conversation about fixing black problems. But I will have lots of conversations about fixing poor people's problems, just people who are poor. If, uh, if anybody wants to have a conversation. And actually I'm deeply involved in this whole this category because I think where this needs to go is lowering the cost of a good life from housing toe energy to your phone bill. Just making all that stuff affordable so that somebody who didn't get a great start in life can still get into a good life and then build from there. In other words, if you handled all your basic living requirements, a low income well, then maybe you can take some classes. Maybe you can work on building your skills, get to the next level. So if you want to work on the problem of how do poor people off any type you write rise up. I'm all over that acknowledging, of course, that as a percentage that would be far more helpful for black people than other groups just because of the way the percentages work. But I don't want to talk about brought black problems anymore. All right, now could I have said that a week ago No, we could go. That would be considered racist. And I believe that it will be considered racist today, so I expect they will get some blowback. But what I'm doing is what some of you can't do. You couldn't have pinned that quote because you would have fired. So the things that I'm gonna be saying in the next few weeks are almost entirely things that would get everyone. Have you fired. You don't need to retweet me, okay? You don't even need to follow May. In fact, it's gonna be dangerous to follow me. You might want unfollowed me and just check my twitter feed if you're interested. S o. I wouldn't necessarily think it's a good idea to follow me in the coming weeks, But here's the Here's what you need to know. Here's Here's the larger picture. I do not have any negative intentions not trying to hurt anybody, all right? 

Not trying to hurt anybody. I'm not even taking sides. All I'm saying is I'm done with white privilege as being something I will accept as polite conversation. It's just not polite conversation. It has no place in public discourse. If you want to say there is a rich person privilege, I will agree. And I'll say, Yeah, you're talking about me now. Do I have privilege? Hell, yes. Are you freaking kidding me? Do you know how much extra privilege you get when you're rich? It's fucking amazing. You should try that. You should try it. You should do whatever you can to get it because it's so good you won't even believe it. So, yeah, there's rich privilege and I will do whatever I can that makes sense for my skill set, etcetera to help poor people, whatever they look like to get what I got. I would like poor people to get what I got. Extra freedom. He wants an extra freedom. I think I can help. You know, That's why I wrote the book, had a failed almost everything and still win big. You will see on Twitter literally every day. People refer to that book on Do say how it changed their life, how they learned how to stack skills, have the use systems instead of goals. Pretty simple stuff. But just those simple reframe ings allowed them to build their life. Substantial and usually a year or two, you know fairly quick results. So I would love those source of useful tools to be more widely available to people who need a hand, whoever they may be. But talking about black problems is just being a sucker to manipulation of social media and people who are jockeying for power and the political process. I declare myself a free person. I declare myself a free person. I'm free. Um, I don't have to. I don't have to frame it the way you tell me to frame it. I don't care that ignoring about ignoring it, because statistically there's something there and they're really ripples from slavery. It's all, really. It's just not special. That's the difference. The problem. Israel. It's just that special. So is it my imagination? Whereas Facebook just turned into a digital photo album run by bigots, why does Facebook stay in business? You've ever asked yourself that, because it's sort of weird at this point, isn't it? The Facebook is this gigantically successful, profitable business, and it's nothing but a digital photo album run by biggest. That doesn't make any sense, does it? And you have to ask yourself Why is this happening? And the answer is kind of dark. I use that word intentionally. There's something very dark happening that that allows Facebook even to be business. And here a few of the things Number one. It is a psychological manipulation. Yeah, the point of of of Facebook in terms of what it's doing to you, the user is it's almost like farming. It's almost like you, the public who uses Facebook or like the livestock, you know, And they're giving him a little, little a shot of this little, uh, yeah, growth hormones and stuff. So, basically, you know, you're just this experimental livestock and Facebook feed you all this psychological manipulation and then they can measure how worked up you get about. Oh, this one got somebody really angry. 

This is making me really angry. Let's promote that one. You know, now that we know this makes people angry, we'll put that in the front of the algorithm. So the first thing that's pure evil about Facebook is that it is a cycle psychological manipulation business model. And by the way, I don't think anybody would argue with that characterization. There are people within the company who would agree with that. That's objectively observe a ble true that psychological manipulation is the primary thing they do, Um, but then there's the business model of selling advertising. You've probably heard the advertising doesn't work. There doesn't some special cases, but for most people, it just sort of doesn't work. Now I know that because I've advertised lots of stuff, different things, from books to restaurants, to you, everything. And so I've seen your Facebook ads being used a lot. I've never seen them or no one's. Now do you think that the people who buy the ads No, it doesn't work well, The people who buy the ads at least the biggest ones, the ones that have the most money and the ones that matter the most are not the people like me who would buy an ad and tested out that sort of thing we're talking about. A big corporation would make a big corporate by the way that's done is that there be an ad agency and the ad agency makes money by getting a company to by the biggest amount of advertising does the more advertising Lee by the MAWR, the agency can charge because they're involved in a bigger deal. All right, so the ad agency has an incentive to lie and manipulate the corporate leaders who do the BIS do they have the power and the technique and the persuasive ability. These air ad agencies literally trained to psychologically manipulate people. 

That is their skill. They've learned that they only get to work at a top ad agency because they have the skills to manipulate minds. And those people with those skills come in and sell their service to some Facebook person who is in charge of buying ads. And they say this is the greatest stuff of the world. It will make you a star, and by the way, you probably don't need to be told this. But, uh, Facebook employees, if you were in charge of a really big budget, you'd probably get paid for, you might get promoted for being somebody who was in charge of a big budget. People would think that's important. So Facebook employees that I'm selling the service. Do you know that your career will be better than mawr? You buy because that's the bigger your budget. So I'm going to give you some bullshit that's not true. And you don't believe it about how well advertisement will work. You're gonna take that that bullshit that you don't believe. But you should get a sell it to your boss. Because if he buys the bullshit that's now went through two filters and he thinks this advertisements gonna work or she thinks this advertisement is gonna work notice that would inclusive I, um then your career will be better. So what's happening is you're seeing the advertisement, which basically doesn't work, except in some specific cases. A specific case would be, for example, a new product that somebody didn't know existed. And they needed it like I didn't know that existence in those limited cases that could be useful. Um, so that's that's their business model. It's basically people selling bullshit to people who want to believe it's true, because that will be good for their career if they act like it's true. So there you go. 

That's Facebook. And now we know from the There was another undercover video this time again by James O. Keefe and Project Veritas. And once again, we're seeing that the people who managed the Facebook algorithms and others are literally Racists. They're literally Racists. And you hear it in their own words. They're not hide again. Pretty much just hate. Ah, White Trump supporters. All right, so that's the business that just doesn't need to exist. Uh, Robert Johnson, the Black Entertainment Television founder. I think you must be a billionaire, he said. It was in an interview with Fox News. Uh, this just made me laugh. If you want to know what kind of mental model makes you a billionaire, this is it, right? So don't think that just in terms of the comment is kind of funny. Think of it in terms off. Oh, that's why he is ability there. This is why he's a billionaire. It's this type of thinking and he says, Uh, Johnson said that those who were destroying statues across the country quote have the mistaken assumption that black people are sitting round cheering for them, saying, Oh my God, look at these white people. They're doing something so important to us. They're taking down the statue of a Civil War general who fought for the South. Now I could not love that better, because really, do you think that there are black people sitting around saying thank you. White people taking down those statues We thought we had some problems to solve. But, man, I think you've taken a bite out of it. We thought we wanted to, you know, make more money and have more freedom and less discrimination. But we didn't know that what we needed was for white people to knock down statues. 

The whole thing is ridiculous. And to watch the way Robert Johnson just so succinctly just took the piss out of the whole thing and summarizes so clearly you can see in just this little quote, you can see why his ability there You take this mindset to anywhere you're gonna you're gonna have some kind of success. Buzzfeed is reporting that the city's that had the big black lives matter. Protests are not seeing any crooner virus spikes. Oh, we're so surprised. Are you surprised that when people march for what Buzzfeed would would support as a good cause? And, of course, less racism is a good cause, and less police brutality is a good cause that when you marched for a good cause, the Corona virus doesn't touch you. Now they've got reasons of course. Maybe it's because of sound doors. Maybe. And this is the funny part. They're saying maybe it's because the protesters were wearing masks and they showed a picture of a bunch of protesters wearing masks. And I said to myself, I have seen a lot of pictures of protesters. I didn't see a lot of masks. They were definitely masked, maybe 40%. What would be recipe that somebody had messed? 30 40%? Uh, I guess it depends which one you're looking at. There were some where they had a lot of masks. Um, And of course, now we're If you want to see the future, let me predict the future. Uh, black lives matter. Protesters do not spread Corona virus. But wait, wait. There's some new information coming in about the future. Yes, Trump rallies do create Corona virus hospitals. Yep. I think we're gonna find that out now. It could be. It's also true. The thing you can't rule out as it's also true, because when you packed people tightly together inside a building and they don't have any masks, which would be a trump rally, and they're yelling, We should be like a choir. If the trump rallies do not cause a spike in Corona virus. I'm gonna be amazed. 

But the truth is, even if it didn't, I think it would still be the news. So let me say that again. Clearly, I've no no medical doctor, but everything we've heard so far especially that like a choir singing together, is guaranteed to spread the Corona virus if any of them have it because it's the, you know, that being close for a long time and exhaling a lot and singing. So the trump rallies are almost designed to create hot spots. I mean, you couldn't come up with a better way to do it and let me say is as bluntly as possible because I whenever I get painted into the corner of saying, um, it looks like I'm agreeing with everything Trump does. I don't agree with everything Trump does. Indeed, having now watched the rallies, I would have to say they're a bad idea. Very bad. In fact, it makes Trump supporters look stupid. Honestly, it just makes him look stupid. Now. I don't think Trump supporters was stupid. Don't That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that the look of It is a really bad look. You know, honestly, when I watched the rallies, I had a different feeling that I'd ever had before. I used to watch them as just entertainment, like I was pretty entertaining and that look a size, that crowd. It's a lot of energy. That's all I would think the last two I thought of. I thought that looks stupid. I'm not saying that people are stupid. I'm saying that the idea of packing people in together without masks and then running continuous footage of those people is the worst possible look, really? No. Some people are saying yes, but freedom, Absolutely, Yeah, If you wanted to look like it's a bunch of people were really were very concerned about freedom even more than health. That's what you got, all right, so if if your priority was freedom probably looked terrific to you. But if you're trying to convince, is somebody who is not already on your team, probably a bad way to do it and you didn't see that much energy in the rallies, so it's not getting the benefit of thought. So, in my opinion, the rally it if if the president held Mawr rallies. 

I think it would just be a mistake. I think it would work against his interest. Frankly, Um, that's just me. All right. Hawk Newsome was making some news. You know, I know Hawk in. He's a leader of black lives matter in New York. And when I was talking to him, I was trying to see if we could find some solutions like specific things that we could recommend. We got a little bit of a little bit of progress and making a list of things that you could actually do. And I think some of those air being were considered in the Tim Scott bill in the Camilla Camilla Harris Bill, etcetera. So some of them have bubbled up. Not necessarily because of us, but but they were just good ideas. And I I broke my contact with Hawk because he needed, for his purposes to be more provocative than I was willing to be associated with. In other words, you know, he was more willing to call white people racist and suggest indirectly or directly that maybe violence could be productive, and those were the thoughts that I didn't want to be associated with. So I broke contact with him, but he's making news again and I want to break out something, he said, because I think it needs some interpretation. I o t o. So he said, quote, if this country doesn't give us what we want in terms of fixing systemic racism, etcetera, If this country doesn't give us what we want, then we will burn down the system and replace it. Newsome responded. All right, and I could be speaking figuratively. I could be speaking literally. It's a matter of interpretation, Um, like, let's be very riel and observe the history of the sixties Bubba Anyway, he makes good points. The violence has been productive and a part of American fabric and including gun ownership. 

You know, when Why are we so afraid? If black people have guns, etcetera. So those are actually some good and interesting contextual points. But here's the part I wanted to point out, um, he says that will burn down the system and replace it. And then he says, All right, and I could be speaking figuratively, and I could be speaking literally. It's a matter of interpretation. No, who says something and then in the very next sentence. They tell you that you could You could interpret it in two different ways. Who does that? Because normally when you communicate, don't you tell people where? You mean Here's how I do it. Well, there two ways to interpret this. I want to be clear that this is the way I'm saying it. Isn't that the way you would communicate if you wanted people to actually really understand what you're thinking? You know, I know there's two ways to see it, but I'm telling you, this is the way I see it, and I'm communicating it this way. I'm not talking about that other way to see it, But Hawk did a completely unexpected thing. Oh, no, you're not. If you if you think this is gonna be a criticism, you're on the wrong page. This is gonna be a compliment to skill. Now, I have told you I'm gonna be consistent about this, regardless of whether somebody has the political opinions that ideo if they employ skill, I'm gonna call it out all right, because I think you need to learn the skill part and then you can apply it to your own moral and ethical world, but this was very skillful. It looks like just a weird sentence, but it's really skilful. And he owes years why Hawk is talking to two separate audiences, and he found a way to talk to them simultaneously, which I've never seen before. 

He needs to talk to his radical base in a way that suggests he's on board with actual violence, like burning stuff down because they need to hear that now. Am I reading his mind? No. He told me that he told me that directly. He told me that he needs to be more radical or he would lose his base. Direct language. There's no interpretation here going out. So was this language in which he says burned down the system? Does that speak to his base? Yes, very well. And how did they interpret it? They say, uh, looks like burning down stuff is on the table. Looks like a little bit of violence Hawk is in favor of. So that's how they would interpret it later. If he is challenged and he will be by white people, um, he'll say, Hey, you could take this as a figurative. And I said that when I said it. I said you could take this is figured it. So taking his figurative and then white people who don't like his message won't and they'll just have their own opinion. But they were going to anyway. But the white people who are sort of supporting black lives matter but don't want to think they're part of anything violent. Do have the option of interpreting get as figurative. In other words, he found a way to talk to the laissez anti far in the white protesters who were siding with black lives matter. He found a way to talk to them at the same time, he was saying essentially the opposite thing, the black lives matter, and he and he pulled it off. He actually pulled it off because everybody reasons is just going to see what they want to see. And I've never seen anybody saying directly, he goes. It's a matter of interpretation. He actually put that right into the original statement. You've never seen that before, and if if you would imagined that this was a good idea and you were not trained in this, you would say that's not a good idea. I was not a good idea to say two things that are opposite and say you can interpret it any way you want. How is that not the worst idea in the world? Here's what you missing. Walk is good at this. He's really good at this. 

You don't know how smart he is. I dio I spent enough time talking to him that he's really smart and he does understand this stuff. And this is not an accident. The fact that he found a way to square a circle that I would have thought wasn't even a thing. He pulled it off. All right, Now I'm not supporting his message or anything like that. So don't take it like that. I'm just saying Skill wise, Pretty good skill. All right, Um, if you thought there was going to be a fair election, I don't think there's any chance of that. Now you could see that Twitter is starting to kick off its the voices that are pro trump. So Raheem Kassam, his a cattle got locked yesterday to be that was the last straw. You know, Carpi dunked him and also got permanently blocked. But between those two, I think that that's no kind of transparent what's going on Before I would have said, Well, you know, maybe this is confirmation bias because they always had a reason for anybody who got, you know, filtered or blocked or whatever the words are. There was always a reason, and, you know, they've got guidelines. So if it fits the guidelines, there's a reason you can't necessarily think that's any kind of, ah, larger political act. But as we see the specific examples, they start to form a pattern that's pretty clear. So the standards air seem to be enforced in one way, but not another. And it does look like the standards are being used as an excuse, a convenient way to kick off the voices that are effective. So watch for people who are effective to be kicked off. We'll see how that goes. 

And I think I've covered most of my most of my important points. Just let me check my notes here, talk among yourselves. Yes, I think you did. All right, so that's all for now. Um, I did go over. I do have an account on parlor parlor is the, um, tiny competitor to Twitter. The problem with parlor is. I think it's just gonna be conservatives go there. If it turned out to be the conservative Twitter, then you're just gonna have ah, left leaning Twitter and right leaning Twitter. But it will have a different name. Onda. All the does is divide us. So I have very mixed opinions about parlor. I don't think it makes sense unless you also keep your Twitter account. But you all get to make your own decisions. So I would do it in addition to Twitter. But I wouldn't do it instead of Twitter unless you're really trying to make a statement of some sort. His Twitter. Unfortunately, whether you like it or not is too important to your your business life for most of you. All right, it's not important to your business life than do what you will. All right, that's it for today. Hope you enjoyed it, and I will talk to you tomorrow. Somebody's telling me that Parlour is is produced. Parlay. Is that true? I hope it's not true, but it might be talk to you later
