balm, Bob. Hey, everybody but it. But it it's time for coffee with Scott Adams. The best coffee was got Adams of the weekend. Yeah, it's gonna be that good. He had. Ah, a lot of it has to do with the thing called the simultaneous ship. And it goes like this. All you need is a couple of other glass detector Chelsea's style. They can't reject a flask of vessel Medicaid. Fill it with your favorite liquid. I like coffee. Enjoy. The now for the unparalleled pleasure. The dopamine hit of the day. The thing that makes everything better except for the news today, which is kind of stupid, but we'll talk about that. Joined me down for this Sybil debut set back up. Uh huh. Well, just when you thought things couldn't get any stupider, they did. Took a new turn. All right, here's my favorite story of the day. We'll start with the funny stuff, so see it end, as you know, uh, dislikes President Trump plotted. Oh, is that be aware that hasn't been covered much. But you see, them doesn't like President Trump, and so would they run a story that could be favorable to him in any way whatsoever. Watching how they word, it is just fascinating. So So here's a story about a team of researchers doctors who are looking at all the existing drugs that might work on Corona virus, that they were doing a really detailed dive. Apparently, this is something they've done before, which they look at all the existing things and see what might be repurposed. So I looked at the study and I say to myself, Huh, This is gonna be a story that has to talk about hydroxy Clark week. How will they speak of it? So I I started the top. It's like blah, blah, blah this other drug, other drugs, other drug, other drug, other drugs, other drug. Now, if this has been a Fox news, they might have mentioned hydroxide calorically a little bit sooner, But I would see it and you have to really look for it's like I got to read quite a bit to get down to this log article. There it waas. So I have to redo the exact language to see how they make something that might be good. Sound like something that might be bad. You're ready All right. Uh, it says one drug, the anti malarial drug hydroxy clerk. Weight has famously received a lot of boosterism from U. S. President Donald Trump s. So the set up is this is President Trump's drug. All right, so here's the next thing they say about it. But in the published studies available for Feigin Bottoms team to review the drug. Hasn't l performed others? Hasn't outperformed others? Is that what you say about a drug that doesn't work? Do you say that it hasn't helped performed others? And do you know what it says about the others? Some of them by work? That's right. So a study in which one of the main findings is that this inexpensive, widely available drug the President Trump likes, apparently works apparently works, according to these researchers. Not according to me, of course, I don't know. But the way they have to word it is the drug hasn't outperformed others. But the study, the whole study, shows that some of them probably work, of course, has to be tested further, But there's some indication of it. And then it goes into this sort of tortured argument about why, well, the two French studies on hydroxy clinically, they drew red flags for the University of Pennsylvania. All right, so these are the guys, sort you get it? Drew red flags. Did you say that about any of the other drugs today? The other drugs draw the red flags. Probably done. Yeah, but because of the time it takes to clear the body Bhola Baba. So the two studies that were positive are not are not conclusive, But that would be true of just about all the studies, I would think anyway, So that's how CNN covers good news. Um, the president is saying that since he imposed this new 10 year term for defacing statues, that hasn't happened. Is that true? Have no statues, but defaced since the president slapped a higher penalty other. And I guess he tweeted 15 different times. Pictures of people who tried to deface that. I think it was the Andrew Jackson statue. Do you think a 10 year prison term is going to stop him? Because the president himself is tweeting the photos of the perpetrators? He did 15 separate tweets of official wanted posters to show the faces of these people. How many of you have any of them. Do you think you've been caught by now? Probably few. Probably a few. So I would think that some of these people are going to jail for a long time. We'll see if that cuts down with it. Eso the, uh, the Trump campaign is probably over. We'll know in about 30 minutes or so whether whether he's still running the story that this cover scrub is apparently the not. Apparently, this happened. I saw it. The president tweeted a video in which sub senior citizens were protesting each other. Some pro trump self anti trump. So it's bunch of old people yelling at each other. But ah, provident part of it is one of the old people who supports Trump yelling White power, White power, some old man in the golf cart Add the president tweeted that So, uh, somebody says it's a hoax. It's not a hoax that tweeted it. So of course the says CNN celebrating, Uh, but I don't know if if that video is still up, the president has inside. Oops, I didn't see that part. Uh, probably his campaign will be over and half an hour or so. So if you want to know what the You want to know what the slaughter beater says now? 00 So the slaughter beater is set a zero. While that video remains unexplained and still up, there isn't any chance he could win at this point. All right, Uh, and by the way, don't ask me to explain that one. All right? We have to listen to the president's explanation. If he gives one, if he doesn't give one, and I would say that would be the end of his end of his a chance to get re elected. All right. Um, there is. Here's a fun story. The reports of an explosion in Iran's eastern mountains caused by a cyber attack. Uh, where would that would have come from? Cyber attack against the red. It turned the facility on itself, destroying Iran's Shahab long range missile force stored in the cache gear total base complex as well as the solid fuel production facility. What? A cyber attack just blew up a whole whole tunnel complex somehow, uh, Iran and destroyed the ship, their Shahab long range missile force. But it's a little unclear because it says the missile force stored in the total. But that's not necessarily the entire missile forces. It did one cyberattack take out Iran's entire long range missile capability. That seems like a lot. Why would they keep it all in one place? Maybe they did. So we want to hear any more about that. I don't think because it was a secret operation by somebody. Somebody gonna be. We don't know. Yes, I guess there's some fake news from The New York Times today out of the source that the president had been briefed that Russia was, uh, was offering bounties to Afghanistan, people to kill Americans. And the story is that the president, uh, you didn't do anything about that. And of course, the president says fake news. Nobody ever briefed any of us. Ah, that, uh So let's let's say handicap this. What do you think of the odds that an anonymous source from The New York Times would have a story that's really bad for the president that involves Russia. It falls Russia and nobody else in the room was aware of it. Does that sound familiar? It anyway, it is the least credible story of all stories. If you were to regs stories from most credible released. Where would you put a New York Times story in the suburb before an election? Uh, with an anonymous source that involves Russia and nobody else in the room heard it. Where would you put that on your list of credible stories at the bottom at the bottom, right? There's nothing you'll hear today. There's nothing you'll hear ever there would be less credible. That's something that has all of those qualities. Nothing. There's literally nothing less credible with that. But because it still has the name New York Times on it, people are sort of stuck in the past. They imagine that that's news of some sort. They still think it's news, so that will be out there forever. Uh, so I've told you, uh, that's always a big mistake to check Twitter right before you try to go to sleep. Have you ever made that mistake? Because Twitter is designed? Well, I wouldn't say design. Don't say that. Uh, it evolved to a point where it gets you excited. When you look at your tweets, it jacks you up. So last night, uh, get ready to fall asleep like, Oh, look a twitter. What war. Okay, uh, there's a death threat against be in public. I don't think I'm gonna sleep so well tonight. So that's the last fucking thing I look at before I go to sleep Is a death threat against me. So that you might say yourself, Scott. A death threat on Twitter? Uh, pretty sure that's against their policy. Well, we will find out because I didn't report it. And I'm gonna tell you what I consider a death threat. And then I want you to put your your opinion on it that we're gonna look at the Twitter rules that seem to be appropriate because I printed them out. You tell me if this tweet should stay up, it's a gray area. It's a gray area. So here's the Here's the tweet is from somebody at Headline Zoo with three owes, I guess Headlines. Who all one word with three overs of the end. And this is responding to that fake news New York Times story that I just mentioned here is the tweet. It should have been clear from the beginning. Trobe is a traitor. What's to be said about his hashtag Vichy Republican enablers at Real James Woods at Scott, Adams says. So here is somebody who has declared that Trump is a trainer because of the fake news New York Times story that didn't happen and that two people in the world should be called out as being Vichy Republican enablers. Now, here's how I interpret that. Yeah, the Vichy meeting the This refers to World War to help me with my history here. So just of just winging it, it would be the French pseudo government that was under the German control in World War Two, essentially traders to the road country because they were bowing to Germany instead of being reverently instead of joining the resistance. I guess so. What happened to the Vichy government after Germany was defeated? This is where I did a little help on by. Yeah, I need a little help out by history here. Did the government officials known as the Vichy, the Vichy government were they rounded up and fucking killed? Just guessing. Would you call somebody a Vichy Republican? Are you not saying by reference that they are in a class category of people that nobody would care? And it might even be a good idea to round them up and kill them, right? Yeah, they were strung up. They were all executed. All right, so is it fair to say that somebody labeling be in the category? That is, even, you would say, might be executed, like even you would say. You know, those Vichy traders if they got executed? Well, good for the good for the people. Because that was probably exactly what needed to be done, right? So by putting me publicly in the category, that not only loves me with James Woods, who I blocked a long time ago just for being a crazy dick, Uh, if you don't like that, that's okay. I don't care. Is sort of a crazy deck. And I blocked in a long time ago. Didn't want to see anything that came in it. His tortured have anymore. Um, all right, so I interpret this is a death threat, but let's see if the Twitter rules would, uh, would bend this person die. Reported it last night. And as of a few bonus moments ago, it's still live. They kept the countess. So here are the rules. Twitter rules, and I'm just picking a few rules out of their many rules. But these are the ones I think apply abuse. Harassment. You may not engage in the targeted harassment of someone or incite others to do so. This includes wishing or hoping that someone experiences physical harm. Now, would you say that that tweet comparing me to to the Vichy republic a group of people who were strung up by their own public? Justifiably, I would say justifiably, there were traders. Do you think that it is targeted? First of all, is it targeted because she mentions me by name? Yes. Is it harassment of someone? I wouldn't call it harassment exactly. Although it is that, of course. Yeah, it is harassment of someone or incite others to do so. Does that tweet in sight? Others to be to act against the the harassing, right? Well, of course it is. Of course it is on. This includes wishing or hoping that someone experiences physical harm. Well, I think that's pretty clear. If somebody somebody compares you to officiate government, they're publically and explicitly wishing or hoping that someone experiences physical harm. No, I've got a mind reader, right, but I don't know how else you would interpret it However, however, if this were the only thing that Twitter said that, you say Okay, this is obviously a violation, but it's not the only thing, Twitter says, because you have to worry about those times when people use words hyperbolically that everyone knows has no violent intent. For example, if I said I'll kill you if you do that again, everybody knows you don't need to kill them. Just a choice. Words. So Twitter has some or language that goes into that in the different section, you have to go look for it, but it's there, says statements that express a wish or hope that someone experiences physical harm. Okay, that's what we're talking about, making vague or indirect threats, what's vague or indirect, kind of a judgment call or threatening actions that are. And here's the key phrase unlikely to cause serious or lasting injury or lasting injury. Lasting injury with l is lasting injury if somebody inside somebody to punch me in the face, but I recover, is that a lasting injury? I need to find a lasting injury that's a tough one. Could a subjective so if it's unlikely to cause serious or lasting injury, are not actionable under this policy, but maybe reviewed it action under those policies. So they take the they reserve the right to review them. But they say we're not automatically bound essentially by our own rules. If it looks like it's not, it's not a real thing, not really in the sense that is unlikely to translate into any kind of action. Now here's the problem. Here's the problem. If you were to look at this one person making one tweet, who do you make the argument that this by itself is likely to cause me any harm? Well, even I would say that's pretty unlikely. Pretty unlikely. Uh, we'll take care of a few people who seem to be suffering. Do do do see. We'll get rid of that one. We'll get rid of that world. We'll get rid of anybody else. Anybody else? All right, we got rid of a few tools, and so here's my point in this. If one person refers to you one time on the winner as being part of a Vichy Vichy government, there's no real harm, wouldn't you say one person one time calls you a traitor? Yeah, nothing. But what happens if it becomes part of the pattern because, you know, Well, uh, when trump loses, because at this point, if that tweet is still up there can't possibly win. Uh, when trump loses, will people actually come after people like me? Well, if there's more of this, yes. So how do you treat a tweet that this person probably hopes would become popular if it doesn't become popular? Is one tweet? It's one crazy person really doesn't make much difference to me or anybody else. How do you judge this? So we'll give you an update on this. In my opinion, this is a call to a call to violence, which by itself is weak. But if it were to gain steam, it would actually kill me. It would actually kill me. I would actually dead literally dead. If this thought picked up popularity to sooner or later, somebody would say, Hey, they really be this. I'll take your crack at it. Uh, let me say is clearly is against anybody wants to take a crack at me later. It won't go well, So if everybody decides they want toe, try to take Theo today or a type of the future. My only advice is make sure you get it done because you don't wanna miss because I may not be as inefficient as you are. The Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury and head of the Church of England, says they're reconsidering their portrait portrayal of Jesus as a white man. So Jesus is about Teoh about Teoh. Uh, get a redo, Get a remake. Now, the interesting thing about all these stories of the things I have to be renamed and change and stuff is that some of them are perfectly reasonable. In my opinion, in my opinion, remaking historical Jesus to look like the actual person who, you know, would it would have looked like seems reasonable. Yeah, I'm not a believer, so I don't have a vote. I don't care if I don't care if it gets down and I don't care if it doesn't get done, but it's certainly in the reasonable category, so I don't mind that one. But here are some of the fun ones, Um, the, you know, Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Princeton. They're all named after basically slave owners or there. Yeah, basically slave owners, people who were involved in slavery. Columbus, Yale. Harvard, the prince referred to with Princeton was came William. They all had slaves. So I guess the Woodrow Woodrow Wilson Um, there was something within Princeton that was called the Woodrow Wilson something They changed that name because Woodrow Wilson was a a massive racist. Sure, he did some good stuff, but he was also a massive racist. Uh, and I'm thinking to myself, I'd like to I'd like to suggest a compromise, but the compromise is this. Instead of changing the names of all these slavers, how about we do this? We just come up with, like, a copyright symbol. Except instead of copyright, It would be like a little, uh, let's say it s for slavery. Yeah, I guess r and C already taken for registered and copyright. So you'd have some kind of like a little letter you put after it. So would let's say it s for slavers. So would be like Harvard. Yes. Where'd you go? I went to Princeton. Yes, but where did you get your degree? Yale. Yes, I'm just kidding. Will never do that, but, uh, watching this take place is quite fascinating. I got to say I have mixed opinions about it all. I have mixed opinions. Um, and the mixed opinions go like this. I think that if we were starting from scratch to naval these things, there's no way in hell we wouldn't named everything after slave owners. If nothing had a name. And we're saying Let's just start naming our buildings and our stuff We never did that before, but let's let's put somebody's day about this stuff. Let's build a statue. I don't know that we would do it that way if we started today. Do we have a right to change history? Well, here's the thing. Let me, uh let me let me give you a little science here to red pill you of these statues and such. It goes like this. If you think that your physical environment is not programming you, you're wrong. Your physical environment is part of the everyday programming before you become. For example, if you live somewhere where you don't have much light your program to be in the worst mood because light is good for you because you vitamin D helps you do it helps your health. So simply having a house that doesn't have windows in the right place. Well, actually program you to be sad and unhappy and less successful, less healthy. Maybe it's that simple. You got light. You're a little bit healthier and happier. You got no life. You're not. But this extends also to things like color and design. And, you know, do you feel claustrophobic? Do you feel creative? Are if you're a person who needs order? Are you in a messy environment? Because imagine, being somebody really needs something. You, uh, would often be o c D. But whatever it is that you did things just where they below. But you, unfortunately have it you don't have a choice. You live in a house where everything is just a mess. What would that do to your brain? Imagine what that does to your brain. Think about it. Programs you now take the generalized. With this, we know that everything in your environment can program you and pretty immediately and pretty grossly. All right, now let me make up example that isn't really okay. Let's say, uh, you're afraid of dogs. We'll just take that as a given right. Most of you are not afraid of dogs, But let's say you were attacked by a dog. When you're a kid, you are afraid of dogs. Is that reasonable? Is it reasonable for a person to be afraid of dogs? If they were attacked by dogs, I would You would say, Well, it might be irrational, but it's quite reasonable that they would be. If you are attacked by something, you have a little PTSD about it. Would you let me just make sense? People would go through. The war will have some PTSD. So imagine you had some PTSD about dogs, but you had to live in in the dog museum. It's like their pictures of dogs on the wall. There is a statue of a dog. There's ah, you know, there's audio playing of dogs barking. You're living in a dog museum. But you're afraid of dogs. And you have a good reason to be afraid of dogs because one attacked you once. What does that do to you? Yeah. How do you like that? Do you like living there? The answer is now. No. That would program you very negatively. You would be able to perform in life. You couldn't be a happy You just never be happy. So The point is that that the decorations literally the decorations, the choice of color, the choice of a painting on the wall the way the room is organized will program you in real time. It will program you in real time. Now, those of you who are saying if I had to estimate I'd say at least 80% of you listening to this are saying some for about this. Oh, by God, Scott, you know, we all have messy rooms. We all have to go through life. There's no way this is a powerful as you're making it out to bay. Yeah, we all have. We all have to ride the bus. Sometimes on the bus is not pretty. I get it, Scott. We'd all like to live in a nice place like you do. But you know, that's life. It's a messy life. Were all that were all effective the same way. Don't make a big thing about it. It's nothing. And I think you're completely role. I think that the power of your your physical environment is way stronger than you. Do you think it iss now? Of course, Thean allergy that I made to the dog analogies are not persuasive. So don't look to the analogy for the persuasion. That was just to give you an idea. What I'm talking about here is the persuasion. If if I told you, you had to live in the space, that was very, very unkind to you personally. But it wouldn't bother me, my good person and by a good person. If I say Hey, you're a guest in my house. I've got three bedrooms they're all available to for you to use. But I want you to use the one that has the dog pictures. Use the one with the dog pictures. Yeah, I know you're afraid of dogs and you'll be traumatized. You have PTSD and you will be able to sleep, but it doesn't bother me. I'm not afraid of dogs. So if I'm not afraid of dogs, I don't care if you sleep in the dog bedroom. Even though there are two other bedrooms that don't have dog pictures in a Why do I care? Because I'm not afraid. The dogs. That's sort of what I'm seeing. So the reason that I'm anti statue, but I'm not in favor of taking down in some nonlegal right away. Every everything has to go through the process because that's that's how we're organized. That's how society works. So I think everything has to go through a legal process. But I think the complaint overall, this quite riel now is anybody. Has anybody ever been traumatized by the names Yale, Harvard, Princeton or Colombia? No. No. Uh, nobody has ever been traumatized because Harvard is named after a slaver. Just hasn't happened. I don't think anybody knew until this year. I didn't know or at least the public didn't know. I didn't know. So, uh, certainly things have gone too far. But if you ask me what I want to live in the world where there was a statue to slave owners if if I had some, you know, generational PTSD about that, I'd say, No. I'd like to get rid of those statues. But if you told me to change the date of these colleges that say, that's too far, but it's the up to May. So we'll see if the liberal institutions gonna live in their own rules. Um, do you remember youtuber? Jenna Marbles? Very, very popular blogged woman who did funny YouTube's. She was gigantic. She canceled herself for her own bad behavior in the past because she did blackface made tasteless jokes. Shane Dawson was another gigantic YouTuber. And by the way, if you have never heard these names, people like Shane Dawson, Jenna Marbles would be like, uh, you know, like the cast of friends basically on television. That's how popular they are on YouTube. They're gigantic names on YouTube. But if you're not in that world, you haven't heard of them. Probably, uh, gigantic names. One just basically apologized for his entire past. Uh, but I can't believe that he but apparently he did black face a number of times in the YouTube, you know, era. And he didn't get canceled for doing black face a number of times already. How many times and Jenna Marbles to How many times could you do blackface of not get cancelled? Is it only this year? This is the first year people are getting canceled for this stuff. What's going on with that? All right, um, so it's mostly fake news and the Croat virus that that video, um, PTSD isn't always about being afraid. That is correct. Somebody says stop apologizing. All right, I'm gonna block you. Whoever said stop apologizing in capital letters. Get a block. You do. And here's the thing. Did you hear me apologize? Did anybody hear anything that sounded like an apology? Nope. I didn't I did not know. I don't know if that's directed at me or not, but I'm sure somebody will tell me I don't like it when people shouting capitals on my covets. Um, why is Trump losing their? Whether there's a video in which, which the president retweeted of a a guy yelling White power? Now, if that's still up Yeah, The thing is, the only defense against that is he didn't really look at it. You didn't really watch the video before. He tweeted. Is there anybody who's ever tweeted a video? They haven't actually watched? Uh, maybe five times a day. That's right. Yeah, People tweet things that they have not read and videos they have not watched. I do it literally every day. Probably there hasn't been a single day of tweeting. I'm just guessing in four years, which I haven't tweeted something I haven't read or I haven't read it or somebody says it's doubt, and most of your saying is still up. Yeah. Now, uh, you know, if it's still up and I don't hear some real good excuse I mean about obviously, uh, So I don't think any of you should support him if he keeps that up. Somebody says he was told us not to trust videos. Exactly. That's why you should wait to hear what they say. You should reserve your judgment until they hear what you hear in the full story. But the only the only explanation I could imagine, really, when I could imagine is that he didn't watch it before. He tweeted it and nobody did. But it's been up there for a while. How's it? So it could be that they don't know how to take it down, Meaning they don't want to just take it down, because then it might look like they meant it, but they got do, you know, scared off it. So maybe they're thinking of something. Don't agree. He's losing. Uh, somebody said they waited in. This is route was was restricted for 59 seconds. Uh, the racist video is still up. You know, it's going to be a an interesting case if he decides to, uh, defend it. I don't think that's gonna happen, but who knows? Whatever. And here's the question. You know, I've been telling you that because the conversation about race and police in particular has gotten deeper. There are things that you can say there are things you can say that you just couldn't say before, So you actually can't say things you were saying. So somebody says the old guys, joking or sarcastic doesn't really matter, does it? That I don't think that would matter it anyway because there's some things that you shouldn't be joking about. And so here's the thing. If if the old man have yelled, you know, Heil Hitler, of course, you know, that would be the worst if he'd yelled. White supremacy, Terrible white nationalism. Terrible. But what if he just yelled White power? Yeah, there might be an interesting free speech case here, and I would be fascinated if the president decided to to back it. Now I think it would be the end of this presidency, but he might, anyway. And that would be this. Is there any reason that that guy can't yelled white power If if there are other people yelling Black power and yeah, other slogans. Is that just his opinion? Because it's not racist. T to say that your own group is good. Is it to just say that you know, you want your group to have power? It's kind of interesting. We'll see if anybody supports it. I don't think you can go there to support it, but I'd love to see what other people do about it. Now, do I personally think that an old man has the right to yell that phrase? Of course. Of course. Old man can yell anything he wants, You know, he wasn't It wasn't an insult to anybody. He was just asserting. He was just asserting something about white people. And I think you're allowed to a certain things about yourself if you're not claiming superiority in this, at least in this society, so we'll see where that goes. Uh, somebody says it's just not great judgment. You don't what do you would you reach a certain age? I don't know if he care, Dia, because the old man is probably just having a great time today. He's probably looking at the news and saying, Lou and I did everybody Hey, you see this president's talking about be Everybody's talking about me. Uh, somebody says, What if he said black power? Yeah. So the point is, if if and been completely legal to say black power is this guy is this will this guy be banned forever for saying white power now? The difference, of course, is that there's a presumed a difference in power. If you're the one who doesn't have power or society looks at it that way. That's a El Bony in power. Nobody cares if you're a lower low power or presumed to be not having enough power. But if you're the one who has power that it just looks like a dictator does it. So context does matter. Old lady yelling Nazi. Is that okay? Oh, good point. Yeah. So the old lady who was yelling at the guy and calling him a Nazi? Yes, she should be condemned equal outside. But she was a white woman yelling at a white man I don't know, gets complications. It gets complicated. Uh, he was being called a racist for supporting trouble, and maybe he responded by yelling White power just toe bother, baby. But you know uh, it doesn't matter. What his intentions were, doesn't I don't think it matters. Uh, Trump would be up 10 if he would just put down his phone. Somebody says, Yeah, you just ruined Trump's election. But he's having a great day. Scarborough thinks Trump is trying to lose. You know what? I heard a few people say that didn't Didn't bike sort of hs the question. If Trump were trying to lose, how would it look different, Right. How would I wouldn't look different if you were trying to lose. And you know, of course, that's a sort of a trick question, because, ah, you know, you could say the same thing about Biden. It looks like Biden's trying to lose. You probably say it about anybody. All right, um, so he says. But we got the sky is falling today. Who knows? You know, there probably will be 25 surprises between down on election day. So, you know, we might not even be talking about this by tomorrow. We'll see. Uh, but it would be really interesting if Trump decided to say, Hey, that guy could yell that if the woman could call him a Nazi. You can. You can yell anything he wants back. Maybe it could if the president is keeping it up there. Let me say this. If the president says, yeah, I can see why that would be offensive, but freedom of speech, then I would actually back in for us. I think I could actually get behind that. You know, as long as he said, Yeah, you know, I don't buy the statement, but freedom of speech. Yeah, I I I doubt I could publicly support that too much, but privately, I'd be saying to myself, That's good point. Yeah.
