Come on, gather round. Grab your containers. You know what I'm talking about? It's time for the best part of the day. Yeah, It's called coffee with Scott Adams. And you have come to the right place for that. Let me tell you. Oh, you're on the hike. Well, that's good for you. This is a perfect entertainment companion for taking a hike. Look at that tree over there. Watch your step. It's like I'm right there with you. All right, everybody. You know what? You need to have a great day to get it off in the right way. All you need is a couple of mugger glass a tanker. Tell Mr Stein the canteen jugar flask. A vessel of any kind. Fill it with your favorite liquid. I like coffee. And join me now for the dopamine hit of the day. The unparalleled pleasure. I usually say those in the other order. It's called the simultaneous Something That happens now. Go. Do you know why I could never be an actor? Well, lots of reasons. But one of them I can't remember lines my memory way. My memory works is very different from other people's, so I can't remember the exact order of anything. 

I'm a little bit dyslexic anyway, so putting things in order is hard. But concepts I could remember forever like a joke. If I hear a joke, remember it forever. So I don't have a bad memory. I have a different memory. Could remember concepts forever, but exact things like phone numbers, not machines. Um, I have had a question that I've had for a long time, and I feel like I got an answer yesterday. It was on the question of what the anti trump people are really thinking, which might be separate from what they're saying. Because you've wondered this to, for example, when you heard the president's critics say that when he referred to the so called whole countries that that was racist, right? And you heard that when he called the kneeling NFL players sons of bitches, you heard that that was racist as well. 

Now, if you're not an anti Trumper, did you know I have the following question in your head, which is Do they mean that, or is that just a convenient attack? Because they can sort of turn it into an attack. Where do they really think that is racist? Because I know that you don't. Yeah, I know that it didn't hit me that way. But of course, you know, maybe buy Filter is different. It doesn't mean it's not racist because it didn't It didn't It didn't hit any particular person that way. I'm just saying I had a question. Do they really believe what they're saying or is it just politics? And I was listening Teoh interview with Cornel West. Um, you may know him these professor or somewhere Harvard. Uh, Harvard Professor, I think African American man, if you don't know him, that's important to the story and a very good spokesperson, just in general, because he's just really he's just good at communicating. And, uh, he's verbally really gifted. 

So you think OK, Cornel West, he's Somebody could maybe help sort out this question, and it turns out he did, But somewhat accidentally, it happened. I think it was Brett Baer. I may have for some reason I remember Cornel West, but I think it was Brett Barrett was interviewing and those two examples came up. So Cornel West brought up the shuttle countries and the SNB's when he brought the S o. B. Is. I think he was, uh, breath bear who just added a little professional context. He's really good at it, by the way, because the way he did it was, yeah, I had to be Bremner The way he did it was he just added the context. It wasn't in any argue mention of way he said, Well, you know that, uh, the context of the sons of bitches was not specifically racial. It Here's what Cornel West said, because the whole point of the S. O. B thing being racial is that it's obviously racial. 

That's a little point, isn't it? And here Brett Baris as well it's not, You know, there was no specific call out to race. How did Cornel West answer that? It was really interesting, he said. It felt like it. Basically, I'm paraphrasing. But what he said was that when he sees ah black person calling Kaepernick included in the category of a sons of bitch, he thinks of Colin's mother and he thinks of other black people, thinks of himself, thinks that maybe like his own son and he takes it personally. And I thought to myself. Well, that's not exactly what people are saying is that because he said fairly clearly that no, it wasn't a racial statement. But it feels like one, because that just the way he processed it was racial, even acknowledging that the president's statement was not intended that way isn't that interesting? It's a clear intention. He's clearly saying There's no indication that the president meant it as a racial statement, and yet it offends him the same way. And the point being Maura, about the, I guess, the carelessness of the president's words that lead you to those feelings. So what about this year old countries? 

Cornel West also explained that you didn't say. Did not say the president says black countries are bad, which is what you think we're saying right when people are criticizing him. What I'd always heard was, Oh, I get it. You think he was only talking about black countries, so that sounds racist to you. I think he was talking about countries that are not producing. You know, highly educated, experienced people who would immediately add to our economy on average, which sounded more economic today. But Cornell West explained it But again, I have to paraphrase cause I don't remember exact words. He explained it that when you call a country that waas, even if one of those countries and most of them were brown with black countries, I think if you call them any kind of an insult, he just takes it personally because he has some connection in his mind and in some cases, maybe an assist me to that country. So he takes it personally. That is really different, isn't it? 

Because in both those examples, he was pretty explicitly acknowledging they has no note. He has no accusation that the president intended it or even had a racial thought. Isn't that interesting? He acknowledged the two of his strongest examples of the president saying Racist stuff has no indication in it that the president meant it that way. What was thinking that way. I always thought that that was the whole point is that he was thinking it that way and meant it that way. Wasn't that the whole point? But the moment that Bret Bear just added that little bit of context, that's all it took and here's what I appreciate about that. I felt like that, Move the ball a little bit like I felt like there was some kind of little breakthrough I was having. So you know, you need and and I had been confused for a long time about this whole situation. Now, if you explain it to me as this was offensive to me and hear the connections about why I felt that that way, I actually accept that completely completely. If what he's saying is this made me feel bad. 

And here are the reasons. And maybe if you were in this situation, you would make you feel bad too. I think, yeah, maybe I could see that I don't have any. I wouldn't argue with that at all. But if you go to the further things, a president in his mind, which were reading from a distance intended it to be racist, were revealed, is in a race inside. Well, that's just crazy talk, But it turns out that Cornel West isn't saying that I could actually work with completely. I mean, we could work with what Cornel West is saying. You know, you can you can you modify your language so it's less offensive to people whose maybe experience. You don't have a full appreciation for To which I say. Sure, sure, I would do that for anybody. Let's say you had a bad experience with you have been attacked by a rhinoceros in your youth. And I start telling you a story about it right now, Serous. And you say, Please, please, please. I know you're not doing this toe hurt me, but you know, right? Astra's talk, it bothers me. And I just sort of take it personally that you would even bring up this conversation. What would you dio? Well, if you're a jerk, you keep talking about right now services right now. 

Sorry. Plural of rhinoceros. Um, so if you don't wanna be a jerk, you would immediately stop talking about right, Nasseri, right? It has nothing to do with race. How about just not being a jerk? Not, you know, not being a dick. It's exactly what I feel about the statues. The people who are arguing that the Confederate statues are, well, technically their history. And, you know, technically they're not meant to be racist. And technically, it's, you know, that it wasn't put up for that purpose, and it's all bullshit. That's that. Nobody cares. Those statues are offensive. You don't get to tell them. They shouldn't be offended. It's not up to you to tell people what is offensive to them. Right? If you put up a decoration into your house and 40% of the people who visited to your house were deeply offended and told you so. My God, I'm really offended by that. Whatever it is, it doesn't have to be a Confederate thing. But if 40% of your guests who you like in love and want to be friends with their family, whatever, if 40% of them come into your house and say I'm I'm offended by that, wouldn't you give it a thought to change your decorations? I think you would. 

If you're a dick, you're gonna argue that the person shouldn't be offended? No. All 40% of the people I know you really shouldn't be that way. So I'm just gonna keep my decorations, and I think you need to get over it. Well, you could do That's a free country right on. The 40% could hate you for it. It's a free country. But why? Why? It's a decoration. You can't get rid of a decoration that's offending your family and your friends 40% of them. The meat is pretty reasonable, pretty reasonable to get rid of that thing. You also hear the argument that something like, uh, 25% somewhere in that neighborhood of African American citizens are in favour of keeping statues. The Confederate ones included. So is that an argument? Well, look, a look at that. If 25% of them are okay with it. It's not about race, but that's not the point. If 75% are deeply offended, it doesn't matter what it's about. It doesn't matter if it's about race. It's deeply offensive. We can't get rid of something that's deeply offensive. Let's be reasonable. Somebody says Isis is also offended by statues. Um, here's my notes. Full Taliban. So, yes, I'm completely aware that if you allow people to get rid of statues on Lee because they're offensive, that you would end up getting rid of all your statues. 

Is that okay? Sure. Yeah, that's OK. Did you think I was gonna be against it? Nope. Nope. Not against it all. Um uh, I'm not wedded to historical things. If they're offensive, um, now the Taliban, of course worm or about getting rid of everything. Now I think where the statue thing is going to go and it seems obvious where this will go, I think you're gonna have people tearing down African American statues. Eventually you have people say, Well, if that would offend you, I'm offended by Martin Luther King. So you're gonna get you're gonna get some kind of troll response. Yeah, that's probably where it'll all end up. But here's the thing. Yeah, the Taliban are pretty much, you know, there's no exception Global. I've got to get rid of everything but getting rid of, ah, statues of slave owners That doesn't feel like going too far to me. And frankly, I don't care where it in something. I'm in favor of Juneteenth as a national holiday. Uh, but I would at least want to give some consideration to the following branding Juneteenth you. 

That could be the name of it. That's a historical name. That's good. But maybe in addition to that, it feels like Independence Day version two point. Oh, doesn't it? You know, in software version 1.0 is Well, it works. That's got a lot of bugs. It's sort of version two point. Oh, that you've got a good chance of getting a good product because they've worked through all the bugs. And, you know, the July 4th Independence Day was allegedly Yeah, a day of freedom. But not so much, right? If you were black, it wasn't your Independence Day, which is the whole point. So it feels like it was Independence Day. Version two point. Oh, was Juneteenth. You don't have to brand it that way, but it just feels that way that that that was the upgrade. That's when we finally started getting it closer to write. Still not completely right, but a lot closer, Um, Mike Pence continues to impress me with his ability to avoid causing trouble. I've said this a bunch of times. I'm not a giant fan of Mike Pence. I don't think you should be president like he doesn't doesn't quite fit for me as president, but as a vice president, I could not have more respect for the way the man is handling his job as a vice president. 

I mean, it's really tremendous, and again it's the dog that doesn't bark right. It's the problems he's not causing. He is really good at avoiding problems. And he was. He was lured into this trap yesterday in some kind of a press conference in which they were trying to get him to do a public gaffe on the black lives matter things. So the trick, of course, is to try to get any prominent Republican to make them say the words black lives matter in public. And, of course, Democrat. Yeah, and, of course, Republicans. I want to say some version of all lives matter. And then that's the traps of people could say, Ah ah, you know, willing to say the words Black lives matter racist, obviously racist. That was an obvious draft. Mike Pence knows it's a trap, and then he walks right into it. All right, so I just told you Wait. Mike Pence's really good at avoiding traps, and he walked right into this. He walked right into it, But here's how he got out. And of course, the news doesn't doesn't like to focus on yeah, the way he got out. So you have to read this story toe, find out his actual wording and stuff, but it's kind of impressive the way he didn't wanna eso. Here's the center. So he was asked the question and he gave some generic response, but he didn't say yes or no, and he didn't use the words. Black lives matter, so the next press person follows up. I guess it was anchor Bryan Taff and he goes, Forgive me for pressing you on this, sir, he says. 

Depends. But I will note you did not say these words. Quote black lives matter. Don't you hate this? Dick is such a dick that this reporter, because there's no there's no news value in this whatsoever. He's not even pretending there's news value in this. He's just trying to trap the president. But the vice president in public, there is just such a dick. Move. Uh, he goes, People are saying, Of course, all lives matter. But to say the words is an acknowledgement that black lives also matter at a time in this country, when it appears that there's a segment of our society that doesn't agree, does it? Does it seem like there's a fucking segment of this society that doesn't agree that black lives matter really? Really. Can you show me one fucking person that would say that I've never even been a racist? Who would say black lives don't matter like literally nobody. There's Yeah, there's a segment of the country they're hiding pretty well because, uh, I mean literally, even racist. Don't say that. Anybody doesn't matter. Like that's just a nobody's mind. All right, Um, here is Mike Pence is quite impressive response to that because quote Well, I don't accept the fact, Brian, that here's the first thing that Pence does. First, he calls him by his first name. He's just so friendly, right? It's a small thing, but I don't think Trump does it right. It Pence's just so smooth here as well. I don't accept the fact, Brian, so he doesn't call the lie. He doesn't say he's a jerk, doesn't call the column and dick like I just did. He goes, Well, I don't accept the fact, Brian, that there's a segment of American society that disagrees in the preciousness and importance of every human life. 

Oh, wow. That is so good. I mean, you don't you don't really realize how good it is until you see what didn't happen, which is it didn't cause a problem, UM, Penn said. And is one of the reasons why, as we advance important reforms in law enforcement as we look for ways to strengthen, improve our public safety in our cities, that we're not going to stop there, that's really could answer. That is such a good answer. It's friendly. It's noncompetitive. It doesn't really. He's simply, Instead of arguing with the point, he makes a defense of the human population the same as I did. He just defended the population, said. I don't think there's somebody out there who thinks that all life is in precious. I thought to myself, I don't know if I've ever heard that, have you? Have you heard a national politician on this topic? Not just say weather. Racism exists system systemic racism exists your sort of arguing about the racism over here. But Pence took it all the way back to root cause right, and he said, I don't believe there's a segment of the society who thinks all lives are not precious, and I thought to myself, I've never met anybody who didn't think that, have you? I've never met anybody who didn't think a life was precious. So Mike Pence, man, he just nails it. And it's like he's like a silent assassin because it just doesn't really get the attention, because that's the way he plays, that he plays it without, Like, he's like the hype. 

The He's like the high board diver who does the perfect dive, and it doesn't doesn't leave a ripple in the water. You just go slices into the water and you go. Did Mike Pence dive into the water because I don't see a ripple? How do you do that? All right, so in my ongoing effort to get, uh, canceled, I tweeted today that systemic racism is a manipulation to room, which I reject. Now, of course, I accept that black lives matter, of course. Now, just so that I could be part of the conversation without distraction. I would like to tack that on first because if you say it directly and you say at first and I would recommend my technique comma off course, because if you don't add the of course you leave, you leave some suggestion that maybe you just arrived at that opinion or something like Well, yesterday I wasn't so sure. But today Yeah, now that I think about it, black lives matter. So comma, Of course. I like to add that to eliminate what we've been talking about. Like, why would you even ask me that dumb fuck question? Of course. Um but here's what my problem was systemic racism as a za phrase. Um, in my views, racism is universal and pervasive, and it's in all things everywhere, wherever they're humans. 

So since humans are pattern recognition machines, but they're not good at it, they're subject to confirmation bias. They don't have the full story. Most of the time, we just don't, um, so wherever they're humans, there is something like bias. You could call it racism, but there's always bias. And, um so the fact that it also exists in systems doesn't add as much to your understanding is you would hope so. The first problem with systemic racism as a phrase is that it's a manipulation phrase. It's a phrase of influence. It's a phrase of persuasion, which is different from a solution oriented description. So I've been pushing back on that phrase because my problem with it is, it doesn't suggest solutions and in fact, it kind of makes you look away from where they might be. So it is a very subtle manipulation because it suggests the solution where it really shouldn't. So, in other words, that it moves. You passed the sail into where you should be looking for a solution, but you really need to be back on the sale you need. You need to be looking a little deeper. That's my problem with it. 

Let me let me say more about that. Um, the problem is that if you say there's systemic racism, the second part of that, it usually is that it's a ripple effect from slavery. And I don't believe there's anybody who would argue that the legacy of slavery did not have a ripple effect, a strong one into the future and the current that, um, disadvantages or has disadvantaged the black community. There's nobody who argues that right. You know, the legacy of slavery, because where was that ship? Ellen was saying that his great great I forget how many greats but somebody that he knew in his lifetime. I think you came from slavery, so it wasn't that long ago, so it's not that hard to imagine. In fact, it's obvious that there's an economic ripple effect. But here's my problem with framing it that way. Let's say you got two kids. What has an unlucky history? And now he's a poor kid. Today he has all the disadvantages of poor kids today. Now none of this was his fault. He had nothing to do with the his grandfather is. It wasn't even born. 

He had nothing to do with choices. They made you just ended up here. Then there's another kid, also an unlucky history. Let's say it's a different kind, different kind of unlucky history. But he wasn't there. The kid wasn't even born. It's people who came before him and did other things. And now he's a poor kid. Now you got to poor kids. Which one? Which one gets the reparations? Which one gets the reparations? Because here's the thing. It doesn't matter why you got there and the systemic racism argument. It's got lots of features to it. But one of the main features is that it implies a solution, and that is persuasion because the solution is implied in the framing of the situation. If you were to frame it differently, your solution would look different. Here's how you would frame it differently. 

If you were solution oriented, you would say it doesn't matter how these kids got here. What's the difference? How they got here like I wasn't I wasn't a slave owner. I didn't cause this kid to be poor. I had nothing to do with it. It doesn't matter that his parents were drug addicts and grand parents were criminals or whatever happened, I had nothing to do with this kid. This kid was just born. It's all they did, was just born. Which one is the favored one? Which one do we want to put our attention on? I would say that it would be unambiguously racist to say that the one who came from a specific kind of history gets more help. Whatever that looks like. Reparations, funding in the government, whatever that looks like, that would be purely racist to say that this person had one kind of history. They got him to this situation. This had another kind and oh, coincidentally all the ones that are like this of the same color that is races by definition, so systemic racism I don't know if it was created for this purpose, but it has the quality of making you think past the details all the way to the solution. It's if you, if you don't study persuasion, it's not is obvious that it's a persuasion term and not a descriptive term. So let me say this. Those who say there is systemic racism. I say to you, You're thinking small. 

There is universal racism. To imagine that it's systemic limits it to well, it's in some situations. It's not in some situations. It's in every situation in which there are people it doesn't. If you replaced your system today with a new system, it would be just as racist because all the people in it are racist and it doesn't matter who they are. We are pattern recognition machines, but we're not good at it. So we're biased about everything all the time, right? It's just it's just the human condition. We try to overcome it with laws and rules, and we tweak him. We fix them and we study them, and we try to use our higher sense of reason from those who have a religious upbringing, maybe a higher moral sense, but we can. We can fight pretty hard to overcome our biases, but we can't get rid of them. So let's let's be realistic about what can and cannot happen. And I think we're just better off if we say, you know, God, I'm just I'm just so biased, you know, Um, you've seen this several times having you know how many how many African American people have you heard in your personal life or in the media? Say something like this? I prefer the racist who were Just tell me the raises. 

The ones who bother may are the suburban soccer mom Mom who pretends she's not, but is alright, How many black people have you heard say that either in public or privately to you, it's fairly common, right? It's like I can deal with Honestly, I can deal with Honestly, it's actually simple to deal with. Oh, you've got this feeling well, you know, good for you. I'll go over here because I'd rather be with people who don't feel like that. Or or How about your an idiot Bob, about Bob? You're an idiot because you're a bigot. And, uh, I've got a PhD so you That's great for you, Bob. Being a bigot. How is your has your g e d? Because I got a PhD, you know, imagining there's a black guy talking to Bob, so you should be able to just just laugh about it, Um, and kind of deal with it as a human condition that you're trying as hard as you can to use your better senses toe overcome. But as soon as you start saying, Well, I don't have any racism. I'm a I'm a good suburban mom. Well, what do you do with that, right? What do you do with that? If you can't talk about it, call it out. 

Joke about it, complain about it, do something about it. Try something. Do something different. Yeah, you're tying yourself in knots. So, um, there's my stand, and I won't even go further. Let me take it to full cancellation. Here it goes. Full cancellation for Scott. Possibly the last time you ever experienced coffee with Scott Adams. Unless, uh, I'm hiding somewhere in the, um, victim. That victim. The witness protection program. Here it comes. I think it's child abuse to tell a young person there is systemic racism. I think it's child abuse to tell young black kids or any kids that there's systemic racism, even if there is. Now, if you're gonna argue. But Scott, there is systemic racism. I'm not arguing that you can call it. Whatever you want. I've already sent is universal. Universal is much bigger than your little complaint about systemic. You know, if you're gonna go small, go small. But you know that's on you. I'm going big. I'm saying everybody's a racist all the time. In every system, all the time. You're saying there's this little systemic racism thing that's a component of that and okay, but I'd rather see the big picture, not the small picture. Here's my point. 

We have science, which seems to clearly indicate that people respond to other people's expectations. We know, for example, that if you do an experiment in which you randomly choose small kids and you say, Hey, you smoke is your the gifted ones, you're you're the smart ones that we're gonna put you in a special class randomly chosen. They are not the smart ones, literally randomly chosen, track them from a year, their grades will be better. It's pretty consistent. It can be reproduced. You tell kids they're smart, they export, they rise to their expectations. You tell kids that they're not smart, and they will. They will lower to that expectation. Kids. Kids need to be told what they can and can't do. And you tell them you tell them directly. You tell them indirectly, but they're here in it. What can I do? What does a kid No kid doesn't know what they can do, doesn't know what they will someday be able to do. They have no idea until they can do it. 

So I would say that telling kids that there is systemic racism and there's this hard to describe force, you know, imagine you're a kid. You don't quite know what all of it even means. If you tell them that you're telling them your life will, you know is gonna be suppressed. You've got this force working against you again if you're just joining me. I'm not saying whether the the racism will hold people back or not. Obviously, it's a negative. I'm not arguing that exists or doesn't exist or is bad. Well, so that's not even part of the conversation the conversation is strategy that whether it exists or doesn't exist, what do you tell the kid? Alright, how about this? Uh, you're you've got some horrible problem in your life. You're an adult. It's just like a horrible problem. Do you tell a small kid? No, no, it doesn't matter if it's true. They're things you tell kids and they're things you just don't tell kids. It doesn't better if it's true. That's not how you manage Children because they don't have obviously developed brains. So if you raise a kid to think that racism is gonna hold them back, do you get the same result as if you raise them to say, Oh, racism's everywhere? You're gonna slice through that like it didn't exist. Which one of them get you? A better result? Overall, every kid is different, but overall, it's not even close. And we know this. We know it completely. We know that telling somebody that they will be held back, we'll hold them back. And we know the telling people that they are not. They're not limited by the problems of life. 

The problems, Ariel. But you're not limited by them. There's nothing that makes that have to affect you. In fact, the existence of racism necessarily creates strategic advantages, necessarily. All right, let me save more about that. If racism did not exist, could a black person walk into any Fortune 500 company and be almost guaranteed a job so long as they have basic qualifications that are, you know, comparable to other people applying for the job? No, they couldn't. They could not if if racism did not exist, could a poor black kid be pretty much guaranteed a college scholarship so long as they get good enough grades? Probably not. Probably not. So if you're a poor, poor black kid born into a family, this as Look, here's the deal. Racism is everywhere. You're not gonna be able to fix that. But here's the cool part, because racism is everywhere. It opens up these lesser but still perfectly acceptable lesser in terms of number channels for you to succeed. And it's basically it's a superhighway you get out of Get out of the forest, walk over the superhighway. 

This as free college, you're gonna get a good job and your life it's gonna look created. Good. Just look over here. Here's the strategy that works over there. There's a strategy that doesn't work. Does racism exist? Yeah, it's everywhere. Well, one affect you a bit. I mean, it'll affect you in your social life and how you feel about things that affect you. That way it's not gonna stop your income. It's not gonna stop you from getting married. Not going to stop you for having a good life. Not gonna stop you from buying a house. Maybe there'll be a little discrimination. So it's everywhere. So, you know, maybe you get turned down for a department and you don't know why. Yeah, that's gonna happen because racism is everywhere. But is there another apartment? Yeah. Yeah. Wasn't like there was one apartment. It's not like it's not like you would be turned down so many times you couldn't get a place. You probably hardly notice it. So imagine if you will the two approaches to a kid. Yes, this thing will hold you back or no, you have strategies will slice through it like it didn't exist. And in fact, you can use it like judo. You can take the energy of it and use it in your advantage. 

One of them is child abuse, and one of them is good mentoring. Um, why do you ask you this? You're an employer. Two candidates come in for a job. One of them believes a systemic racism exists and has been a big problem in their life. One of them believes that racism exists everywhere is just everywhere, but that the skin is a he or she, uh, has good strategies to overcoming or a slice through it. Which one do you hire? Do you hire someone who believes that there under the yoke of systemic racism, and then you bring them into your company? How's that gonna work out? How's that gonna work out for you as an employer? Nothing to do with being black. Nothing to do with being black. It's a lot of race question. If you bring me an employee who believes the system is screwing them, I don't walk. I don't want to be anywhere near that Employees that employees going to sue you there already primed. They're primed for it. Do you think confirmation bias will stop working the day you hire this person? Know the person who believes that systemic racism is the you know, sort of an organizing model of their world is going to see it everywhere. Begin their telling you they're telling you directly. I believe there is systemic racism. So sure they're going to see it. They're going to see it where it exists and also where it doesn't and not because they're black. Not because anything they're just people. 

The human condition is that confirmation bias affects all of us all the time. You're not immune from it. Nobody is. So if you if you have somebody who has a framework in their head, then they should expect that confirmation bias will fill in the framework. And you're basically just asking yourself to get sued down the road. Eso So keep that in mind if you go looking for a job. I don't think you want anything on your social media history that says you believe systemic racism is holding you back. Now if you're a white person and you said systemic racism is bad, it probably wouldn't hurt you for a job interview. Might help you, right? I mean, maybe if you had a person of color who was interviewing you, they look at that and say, Oh, there's an open minded person, I'll hire them. But if you're black and you come into a job interview with a black employer, how about this? It's, Ah, a black hiring manager in a black, um, candidate in one of the candidates that, actually, let's say all three of them with black, just keep it easy. Two black candidates of one black hiring manager and one of the candidates says racism, systemic racism is a problem in their life, and the other one says, Well, racism's everywhere, but it's not bother. May you know who do you hire them? It's a no brainer. All right, um, we'll see. 

The other thing that a systemic racism does is that it forces you to look in one place for solutions, doesn't it? So what do Republicans say is the problem with the black community? I'm not a Republican, so I'm just summarizing those views. I think most of them would say that if you get the family unit right, then other things work out. I feel that's a little simplistic. All right, so I'm not on board with the strong family unit is the secret to success because I think that only works for some people in some situations, and when it does, it works great. I'm very jealous of anybody who can you make the strong family unit work, so it makes sense that people have made it work for themselves and their friends. They would say This work for us. You should try. I just don't think it translates into every situation. So, um, maybe you need something better. But here's the thing. If you say systemic racism, racism is the organizing thing that you're working on. Um, where do you look for your solutions at the system, right. If you think that systemic racism is the problem, you would look at the systems. Does it it? It manipulates you. Teoh. Look past the question of where the problem is and where is the best place to fix it. It makes you think past that to know which systems are we working on, right. 

So that's why it's manipulative, and it's a persuasion term. It's not a helpful time. It's not a problem solving term. It's a political term that's intended to get your emotions up and two under offense attention, but it makes you look in their own place and what I say by the wrong places, one place in particular. Maybe it's not the wrong place. It's just it forces you to look in one place. I would rather say, What could you do with, Let's say, schools and families and early education and stuff? Because wouldn't you say that by the time the kid is 18 it doesn't matter what the other systems air doing. He's in trouble if the entire problem is caused by the time the kid graduates high school or drops out of high school. If all of the problems air baked into that person by that point, in other words, they didn't get the education. And then, you know they've got a jail record. Wherever it is, they're on drugs. Of course, that's gonna ripple into the future. There's nothing you could do fixing the system that's gonna fix any of that. 

So I feel that calling a systemic racism makes you look away from the 1st 18 years of life, even though the school is a system, but you don't see people talk about that as much right schools the system. You're really family. Life's a system, but that's not what they're talking about, is it? You know, of course, the school's air worse in the inner cities, and I do think that needs to be fixed, but systemic racism makes you look in the wrong place. That said, as I said before, the one place that just stands out is in the justice system. It really, really stands out there. And I think that if you say, Hey, the justice system is creating these unequal outcomes, what do we do about that? I would say, Oh, that's worth looking into. Nobody wants on equal outcomes. There's nobody has that is an objective. So if you say we're not, we're not getting equal outcomes. In theory, you have every white person in the world on your side on day one. Hey, look at this unequal outcomes. What white person says, Oh, that's the way I wanted it. I wanted it to be unequal outcomes. 

Nobody. Nobody. Zero people have that opinion. So if there's a statistical measurable problem, yeah, you got all the help in the world's fixing net. And I've suggested, for example, that if you have unequal outcomes in the justice system that maybe there was a way to anonima eyes the information that the judge used. Give that to some independent people who can't tell the race or ethnicity of the person involved and just have them see a Wait a minute. This decision is an allied with the average even considering all the extenuating circumstances in the and the the prison record of the person, etcetera, than maybe you could get rid of racism if some way you could anonima ISAT And have you known external people bring bring things back to the norm? So there are lots of ways to deal with, ah, problems with your system and I'm all for it. But calling a systemic racism as the unifying principle is misleading and ultimately racist, actually, Yeah, unintentionally. Um, all right, I feel like it's just a broken record on all these topics. Um, unequal inputs create unequal outcomes. Someone sentence. Yes, that's true. But unequal systems would do that as well. 

Somebody said, Did ho tep Jesus block me? If so, why? The answer is no. He made a public joke about blocking me, which you should have recognized as a joke. I did see him blocking people for not being smart enough to know it was a joke. So I guess you lucky you got away without getting blocked. So no hotel. Jesus and I have no reason that either of us would block interest. Um, predictions for Tulsa today. Well, let me tell you, uh, let me answer that by telling you my experience last night. So last night, I went to dinner, uh, at a restaurant in my town for the first time. Um, yeah, in my town for the first time. Yeah. And remember, early on in the pandemic, I was suggesting that the restaurants that could I would close the street so that they could move their seating into the street. And it would be, you know, just outdoor seating for the summer, at least until the weather changes in my work. Now, I suggested that to the new one of the leading restaurant tours in my town Friend of mine, and I think he took it to the town. But in any case, last night, Main Street was blocked off and going forward, I think I don't know if it's every weekend might be, it might only be weekends. I'm not sure yet, but, um, so it and it went to an eight in the middle of Main Street so that tables were spaced out. 

Now here is my experience. I don't think that more than one in three people at Mass on last night it was a crowd situation because even though the restaurant thought it was extending its table seating into the street, that's not what the public thought. Yeah, so when when you imagine this, you save yourself. That sounds pretty good to be seats outside. The weather's great. The weather was perfect seats in the street, but a really nice street. You know, it's perfect seating, really, And you think, Can you imagine that you like? Oh, we're all sitting at their tables with lots of distance. That sounds very pleasant, but it turns out that the residents who were not there to eat, of which there are many just walking about, decided that it was a street fair, the street fair, meaning that crowds of people were in and among the tables and the table I was that was right next to some bro's some white Breaux's you know, some twentysomethings who talked too loudly when their friends come by. You know what that is right. Here's here is a 40 something when their friend comes by unexpectedly. Hey, Bob, I haven't seen you in a while, all right? Now, here's the 20 year old bro. When he sees his friend, he hasn't seen a while. Oh, and then his friend sees him and goes, huh? And they both shout as hard as they can. 

But they try to get the deep the deep, manly shelves who who? And it becomes this whole, like Simeone New, you know, eight like situation where they're all trying to be louder and more aggressive and slapping each other hard, ever hugging each other harder chickens heard and in you establishing their territory and trying to elf up and stuff. And so as a result, yeah, there were four of the bro is right next to us and they were really loud. And then their friends come over now their friends were standing around the table and starting to crowd our table and they're really, really loud. And then another group of their friends come. And the next thing I'm I'm basically, you know, right on the edge of a large group of large men who are effectively none of the net masks. Zero master in the entire group. None of them were quarantining together and they all just came to this one table. So there was like, now there were a 1,000,000 different contacts all represented at the table right next to me. And they were all shouting drunk. I don't know if they're all drunk, but they're all there was shouting like drunks who? Oh, and it just went on for, like, 40 minutes now. 

Was I exposed to the Corona virus? Yes, yes, I waas and I thought about what do you do in this situation? Because I should have walked out, right? I mean, for safety reasons, I should have just walked out, But I didn't want to penalize the restaurant. And I didn't want toe pay and not eat. I mean, the whole point was, I wanted to go in, so my my personal restaurant experience was completely ruined, Uh, by loud broz who were trying to kill me because they didn't have any risk that the young people didn't really have any risk. But they didn't give a fuck that I did. Let me tell you, it was one older guy that was with the younger guys and he was like, I don't touch me, Don't touch me. But he didn't have a mask on either. So he's probably dead. We'll never see him again. That guy died anyway. The point is, what I What I witnessed last night was almost complete destruction of the medical recommendations. I don't know how much of that was unique to the situation, but I kind of feel like it wasn't unique. 

And while Trump supporters might be really good at wearing masks because I imagine they'll probably handing them out, I'd be real surprised if they're not, you know, Maga facemasks. Although that would be a terrible idea because then people would wear them in public later, and then they get their ass kicked. So I hope they don't have those a lister generic. Um, but it could be I. First of all, I think that nobody is. Nobody is taking it seriously in California, at least in my area. On, by the way, the police, the police were there. So you know California, you're supposed to have a face mask. As of the other day, you're supposed to have a face mask in these crowded public areas all the time. The police were right in the middle of that crowded area, and we're not enforcing anything, nor do I think they could have. So I'm not blaming them. I don't think they hadn't really an option to do anything. The entire street was filled with massless people. There were two cops of what could they do? So you assume the risk. That is correct. You do assume the risk. What do you call a gathering of bro's? A bunch of 20 something white guys. We talked too loud, and, you know, they like sports. Um, young guys don't care is rampant. Yeah, I would say that. Young males certainly are not gonna be wearing masks. Um, not, you know, I'm looking at your comments. So you similar. All right, that's it for today. And I will talk to you tomorrow.
