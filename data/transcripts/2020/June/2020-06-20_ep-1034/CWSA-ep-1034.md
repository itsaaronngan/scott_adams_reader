toe to toe Teoh. Everybody come on in. It's time for coffee was got Adams. Yes, it ISS and you came to the right place. And before we get going, what do we need? That's right. You need a cup or a mug or glass? A tanker? Chelsea's dialect, canteen, jug or flask of vessel of any kind. Fill it with the favorite little liquid Happy Father's Day and join me now for the dopamine here, The day the thing that makes everything better that's gonna spike your, uh, every part of your chemistry of your body. It's gonna be good. It's gonna be great. It's called the simultaneous sipping That happens. That will go. Uh huh. Now I'd like you to play a game with me that I call Kuvin, canceled or dead. All right, that's the game is called Cove. It canceled or dead. The new way you play, it is you see a celebrity trending on Twitter, and you say we'll see who's trending on Twitter. Justin Bieber Is it because he has cove it? He is cancelled or he's dead. Who's got a guess? Before we check Cove, it canceled or dead. Let's check due to do Justin Bieber. Oh, my canceled a little bit of me to action going on there with Justin Bieber's. So Covad canceled her dead. You could play it every morning, every morning. There's a new celebrity, and I say this one. Koven canceled her dead and, uh, been pretty good so far. All right, Uh, it's pretty. Catches a covert, canceled her dead. Come on, you're going to be saying this all day long. You know, you are, uh, if you have not watched my new video, Siri's called. Had to do things like a boomer. I pinned one of the videos to it. I'll probably have more of them in the locals platform where subscribers can see them, but I like to release a few than publicly just seek and see what's going on. Now if you think those videos are just for fun, because the theme of Is Me tried to open ordinary consumer packaging and it doesn't go well, that's the basic theme. There's There's a larger user interface point coming, and for some of you, you'll see that later. All right, here's a weird thing about the Corona virus. It keeps making something's better. Have you notice that Have you noticed that Corona virus? It's making a lot of things worse. I mean, that's where all the news is, of course, but there's some things that are just definitely better. Let me give you an example. So I told you, we have outdoor seating. Bill, Uh, we have outdoor seating for the restaurants in my town. Now, I don't know if they took my suggestion or they just came up with the brother own. I do know I made a suggestion through the biggest restaurant owner in town, and he was gonna contact the city, so I don't know if it was because of me, but they way my my main street now is closed down for restaurant hours, and the restaurants bring their tables into the into the street. It becomes sort of like a street fair atmosphere. Now, the first thing that I noticed Waas it was way better than eating indoors. There's loads and weather is okay. It was way better. Uh, so I know some of you were obsessing about this. We'll talk about that later. Um, so one of the things is better is, uh, one of the things you hate most about restaurants. Number one. You hate getting a bad table, right? You go to a restaurant, you make all this trouble that you see you at one of those tables where you're on the side of the table where all you're looking at is the person on the other side of the table in a wall. Well, you're looking at is a wall and the other people and you think to yourself, Well, did I really need to go out to eat tonight? That just looking at a wall and people I could be with anywhere. But if you're eating outdoors, everybody has a good view because you're outdoors. So there's sort of a 3 60 view, so eating outdoors is better. But then this six foot, um, this six foot distance thing. Uh, by the way, I'm not married. I have the ring. I have the ring ahead of the marriage. So I was just wearing it, But I'm not married kids. You wondered soon. Soon. I swear it's gonna happen. Uh, we got delayed several times because of the covert thing, So we're sort of were improvising as quickly as we can to figure it out of bacon will work. But I digress. I love having restaurant table six feet apart because the other thing you heard about a restaurant is that the people near you can hear your conversation and you can hear there's so six feet apart, way better outdoor seating, you know, plentiful outdoor seating and the on the street. That's kind of a very attractive street by kiss, much better. And then the third thing that I really like one of the things that my pet peeves about restaurants prior to Cove it is. I would hate it when my food would come where I had my brand or anything, and the server would stand directly above the table or the manager would come over to talk to you, whatever. They would talk directly above your food. No, maybe I'm the only person who's bothered by that, but I don't like anybody talking above my food. I don't need to fill in the blanks, right, So I'm usually like if I'm listening to the server, the manager comes over, I'll be, uh, yeah, you were enjoying. They'll be moving by bread played over whole. You're moving out of the sprays out a very nice restaurant. Thank you. Yes, we have got all the salt I need by fork. I got a fork. We don't need to be talking anymore. I'm slowly moving my food. And in the spring zone, now server comes over with a mask, and I'm thinking I like this for all the time. I like this forever. Could we do more of this? Yesterday I was gonna go out to do some errands and that had just been drinking some coffee, as I often dio. Normally, if I'm gonna go out in public, I might encounter some people. And I would probably used mouthwash or brush my teeth again just cause I don't want have coffee breath. But I started to go do the bath wash before I went out and I thought to myself, No, I don't need this. A word of mask. So I just put out the Basque like, well saved step. No mouth washing from Gloria. All right, but enough that two things we know for sure in 2020 fact, check me on this. There are two things we know that we all know. So this is something that the left knows. It's something that the right nose. And every independent knows two things. See, if you agree with both of them, number one the only sensible way to make decisions is by looking at the data and listening to the experts. That's one thing we know. God, look at the data you got looking the experts. The second thing we know in 2020 all the data is shit, and the experts are lying. So we've actually, as a society, we've agreed of the following process is the only thing we agree on. You kind of look at the data and you gotta listen to the experts and the data is all wrong and the experts are lying. We agree on both of those things. And yet we've agreed that that's the system that we're all gonna live under. Unfortunately, I don't have a better system. If I had a better system, I would be recommending it to you. I don't think magic is better system. I don't think gassings a better system, but you certainly have to watch out for the date of the experts these days. Now, the big news, of course, was the rally last night. So you may have missed this little tidbit. I'll just toss this out here not important in any way. Very small. Trivial little fact. Don't bother yourself with it, because it was lots of news last night about Presidents Trump's use of words. That's the important stuff, not this minor little story here. Ah, European spacecraft has found oxygen on Mars. What? What Oxygen of Mars. Now, of course, if this is like most other stories, as in 99% of stories that sound a little bit like this, you know what I need? There's some stories that sound like other stories but are different. And all the details, this one about oxygen on Mars. I'm gonna put this in the category of things that later turned out to be bullshit. That doesn't mean it ISS. But have I mentioned that in 2020 all the data is shit. All the experts are lying, so that's your context for the story. Hey, we spotted oxygen on Mars because it's a green glow or whatever to which I say to myself or or there's no oxygen on Mars and you just foolish it just just put that out. There is the other possibility. That's 99% likely, so I wouldn't count on oxygen on Mars. All right, um, but that's a story. There's, ah, fascinating story about Southern District of New York prosecutor who is looking into Rudy Giuliani. He and some Trump associates. And he was either fired or quit or Trump fired him or bar did. Or Trump told Bart if I room or Bar said he'd fire him and Trump said, Okay or Trump didn't know Inbar fired him or Bar didn't know anything about it, and Trump fired him. Or possibly he just quit and Bar thought he was fired, but Trump said he was fired. But possibly there's oxygen on Mars, so I don't have any interest in this story whatsoever. I can't try to think they keep talking about this story, and sooner or later I'm going to get interested. Nope. I just have lost all interest in old lawyer story airs stories. How many times have we heard there's a thing with a lawyer? This will be the end of Trump. How many times have you heard that datum story? It's a lot. The details are always different, but there's always a lawyer. It's the end of trump sometimes there to lawyers, and this will be the end of Trump. He's finished now because I've got a story and it's got a lawyer. That's the individual. So I'm sure this story about the prosecutor is the end of Trump because you got fired allegedly for being good at his job. But that will easily be spun by bar as being bad at his job. So there's nothing here, but it's a story. Here's an interesting, uh, the thing, dear, that Raz psa bowed the alleged warlord of the autonomous So, um, is neither a warlord nor a member of the autonomous owed. If you were watching only right oriented new sources. Did you think that raz its abode? So use the guy who came in. He's got the He's got the, uh, the weapons and use and the weapons. And he seems to be sort of handling security in the, uh, time episode. I was looking at his his Web about his Web is his Twitter feed, and he answered somebody early on. Just maybe we could go over some. He answered somebody, uh, and he clarified. He said, he's No, he's not autonomous, meaning he's not a member of the Autonomous Zone. He's an American citizen. So what? Asked to describe himself while he wasn't asked, he just volunteered that he doesn't hate, doesn't identify with the hotel episode protesters. You know, he identifies with America. Just think about it. Just think about that, he says explicitly and publicly. No, I identify with America. I'm just helping out. That's really different than what you've been told. Is it now? Just because he said it doesn't mean it's true. That's that's everything we know about the world. But, um uh, it sort of looks like maybe that is actually the case and that he's a little bit more thoughtful, a little bit more complicated. Then the right leaning reported hasn't decayed, so I'm just gonna put it out there. A little bug in your head. I don't know what the deal is with him, and I'm not. I'm not endorsing. I'm not telling you. Oh, he's a good guy, you know? We should be. We should be comfortable with them. He did hand out weapons toe people from the trunk of his car. We don't know what that is, and somebody did get shot recently. I'm not saying that's connected in any way is probably not. But we got questions, so they're more unanswered questions than there are answers. But I'll just put that bug in your mind that he's a little more complicated. Maybe in a good way, then you think so. Don't just I'll just ask you to reserve judgment about the whole rags situation until we know a lot more. I'm not endorsing, not endorsing anything he's doing just saying There's something here we need to know more about And I don't think you've been well served by your news sources, That's all. Now. Part of that story is that if you saw this, this was horrible. So somebody got a shot and ended up dying. They bled out in the autonomous and don't know the details. But the medics from outside the zone showed up with their ambulances and they stopped at the That's sort of the border, but nobody was stopping them from coming in. So we saw the video over. There seemed to be a you open road. There were no protesters, and in fact it was somebody from the Order or time episode begging them to come all the way and they were on the radio is waiting for, I guess. Police. I think it was police approval to go into the zone now. They decided not to until it was too late or they didn't. I forget. I think I think they probably waited for the the body to be taken out, actually, and under no other details that might have that last part role. But the point is that they intentionally waited while that guy was bleeding to that, and they decided that it was too dangerous to go in, even though there was no immediate obvious threat where they were on the border before they wouldn't deli. There will be much discussion. There will be much discussion about whether there's medical professionals, um, were, let's say, not doing their duty by not accepting the extra danger, which, of course, I think everybody would agree there's some danger of living in that zone. I don't know how much, but they did not accept that extra danger because they did not feel it was a secure place and they let him bleed out How much of that was political, Do you think? Do you think that whoever was telling them not to go in because it wasn't their decision really exposed. They could have violated orders but that they get fired. Um, do you think that the people who told them not to go in we're concerned Onley about their safety? Or do you think that they used the guy bleeding out as a political pawn? They just let him die to make a point because they did make a point. I'm not sure it's the point they wanted to pay, but they did make a point. And the point is, this autonomous zone isn't isn't functional, doesn't work, it can keep you alive. And so somebody I'm seeing in the comments that somebody's calling them cowards. I don't think that's what was going on. My guess is that the people in the the ambulances were in a tough situation, but I don't think one stop them was fear. I don't I don't I see because my I guess I'm biased because I feel like people who do that job. I mean, if you could be an emergency medical person, I just don't know if physical fear is a big part of your life, because you you must have overcome that somehow even to just do your job. So I don't know that they were afraid. I do know they had orders not to go in and they decided to follow the orders. Now, is that wrong? I don't know. But you'd have to ask yourself, Did the medics help or hurt the situation in the long run? Because by not going in, they didn't make the point that you gotta wind this thing down. They did it by letting somebody died. Perhaps I don't know that, but have saved lives. They may have saved future lives by letting a few die, because maybe that one's a down faster. Who knows hard to score that one, but its tragic either way. And just about two years ago this summer, I sat in the President's Oval Office, and this is the one thing I will tell you just because it makes the president look smart. So I don't think he would mind if I told you this one little tidbit from the conversation. And that was that he predicted two years ago, the president did. To me personally, the Biden would be the nominee pretty good, right? S 02 years before it happened. President Trump's instincts and lots of other people picked Biden as well, so it wasn't that surprising. But you pick Biden two years ago and he was right. Okay, So you have to give him that. That bit of insight and instinct I can. I can personally vouch for his confident prediction that it wouldn't be violent. That is right now. I sat there and I said that it would be Kabul Harris now think about two years ago, where was Kabul Harris? She was not even in the primaries yet. So that was a pretty bold call that I picked, You know, one politician and of you, Big Swarm. And she's made it apparently all the way to the vice presidential finals. But what's interesting is that when she dropped out of the of the race for to be the top spot, I continued with my prediction and said that she would re emerge retrained. This is the important part. I said that she would be retrained by the top level professionals in the country. You know the people were really, really good at it and that she would emerge almost like a different candidate stronger, more confident, more capable of communicating, saying the right things, never their own things, that sort of thing. And that has happened. That's happened if you've watched her for last month. She is a completely different candidate. She's changed her look. She has fixed her body language because she usedto talk like jumpy. Her shoulders will move when she's talking, and it just looked unconfident. She stopped it. After a lifetime of that activity in the last month, she stopped her entire body language thing. Now you could do that if you practice, but it's, I guarantee, there was some external source who said, Look, you've got to get your body under control Send in the road signal And she has the other thing. Was her unconfident laugh. She would laugh in her own jokes, huh? And if you saw her laughing and answering about in the debate, she said that it was just a debate that she laughed. It was more of a covenant laugh. In other words, she was laughing not at her own joke, unconfident Lee. She was laughing at the person to ask the joke for being so silly. That's a whole different laugh and it works. Here's the next thing she did eso. Yesterday she tweeted this Kabul Harris tweets. I was raised to know that being black means that you were capable of doing anything that if we're committed, if we're deep in faith, we can do anything. But it requires resilience and, most of all, love of self. And it's a wonderful thing. Now that is almost a pure Republican tweet, isn't it? The Republican point of view is the only thing stopping you is yourself way. Took care of making the laws fair, a spare as we can, you know, deeds, lots of tweaking, but least a paper their fair. So the thing that's holding you back is your own motivation of your own effort. You know your own life choices. It's very Republican. And so don't trouble Harris just out of nowhere. She wasn't prompted to say it has volunteered the most Republican statement you've ever heard. Now she can still, you know, say that there's a victim thing going on as well, so she doesn't have to abandon that, but notice she's triangulating. That's the Clinton strategy triangulation. In other words, she's starting to move toward the center where everybody could agree. Gonna talk about this, actually talk about it. Now let's go to the white board. Have said this before, but I figured a a better wayto presented. So I think that's worth doing. Forget about the shadows here. So the GOP of the Democrats have different views of what equality should or or is. And this is a generalization that doesn't apply to any one person, right? So just in general, the Republicans think that if you have equality of rights and equality of opportunity while you're done, the rest is up to you. Right? As long as we did the laws equal on paper, it's up to you working it in general, right? They got these air gross generalizations. The Democrats are a little more focused of outcomes, which is hey, you know, Yeah, I see. On paper, it looks good, but our outcomes are different, so that that's something that must be fixed. We gotta figure out how to get the problems better, whatever that takes and these air hard to resolve. And my suggestion is that the useful middle ground, the triangulation place the the place that a national candidate could find agreement on both the left and right is a quality of strategies. What I mean by that Here's what I mean a zey white person in America. Do I have enough strategies for success? The answer is yes. Yes, As a white person in America, I have plenty of strategies for success. Stay in a jail, don't do drugs. You go to a good school. Um, that's it. Because if I do those things and I'm a white person in America, sooner or later I could get a job. And I can, you know, make something, make something work out. But suppose on black in America, Do I have the same strategies or different strategies? As long as I have plentiful strategies for success, does it matter if they're exactly the same as someone else's strategies? Not so much, not so much. For example, if I said I'm gonna give you $100 and I'm gonna reach into my right pocket and give it to you. Do you care if I say I would do my right pocket in the left pocket? Does it better? You know, you just you got your $100 and you didn't do any extra work Either way, they're all equal. So I would say that if one group has a good basket of strategies, all of them are perfectly acceptable. But they're different from somebody else's basket of strategies. I would say that you have a quality of strategy so long as both baskets or full of good strategies that don't have any limitations prepared to the other basket. So if you're a black person in America, can you do you have the option? It might be harder because of, you know, let's say if you're in interceded, you have different pressures, but you still can not do drugs. Pay attention in school. Your school is worse. Perhaps, UM, go to college, get a college scholarship. So if you're black, you have you have extra an extra strategy because you're more likely to be able to get a college scholarship. If you get a college degree or it could be anything could be a trade. You learning a trade doesn't have to be college. Once you're ready for the workforce, do you have a strategy for getting a job in our big old racist, discriminating world? And the answer is yes, yes, unlike the white person strategy, which is I'll just go get a job. There's nothing really stopping me. Black people might have some racism. Depending on the situation. There could be some racism that they have to overcome. But they also have a strategy that white people don't have, which is being black. You could go into any Fortune 500 company, and I really mean it, Eddie, pretty much under present of every Fortune 500 company. Take your college degree and say I'd like to get a job and they will hire you practically before you get the sentence out of your mouth because they have great pressure to improve diversity. So if you go in there with some skills, they can use its Yes, it's yes, and they also need to make sure that they've got enough diversity and senior management. So are they gonna overlook you if you're black, or are they going to give you a really good look cause they really need you to succeed? And yesterday is going to give you a really hard look and maybe pick you above other people, even if they don't say that, because it helps senior management to promote black employees because it makes them look good. Hey, look at being I got some diversity here. So I believe that Children especially need to be taught that all those strategies might be different. Although racism is pervasive and universal, and no matter what you do about it, you can't get rid of all of it. It's just sort of baked into our human experience. You can try as hard as you can. But if you're talking about what is equal when it's fair, what is what is the standard by which we should measure how well we're doing as a society? I would argue that if everybody has strategies for success, that that's about as fair as you could get. Yeah, there there might be an idealized level of fairness that you'd like to accomplish. That might be just impossible. But the best you can get in the real world is you've all got a path. They're just different paths. So if Topple Harris were to take an approach like this and say, look, racism exists, everybody agrees, will do what we can. We'll tweak. These systems will try toe, get more control over the judicial system in particular, but the real thing is strategy. Let's let's get a strategy for success. Let's fix the schools, whatever. By the way, if I had to, if I had to pick one source of racism like if you look at all the things you would need to fix to reduce, let's say, racial outcomes, you don't have to say racism. He could say Racial l comes so that black students you could do better. How do you improve that? Every pore student could be better and to improve that if you could take take it down to one problem, what would it be? Let's say one thing you could fix. What would it bay? Here's my vote. The teachers unions. I'm not an expert in this field, but from what I can see, the existence of the teachers unions makes racism possible and promotes it because you can't fix the schools unless you have some choice. It's in competition. By understanding is that black lives matter and Republicans agree of the following point. Wouldn't it be nice to have better schools for black people that this is where Republicans and black lives matter are of the same page? Wouldn't it be nice to have better schools for black people and for everybody. Of course, the Republicans would just say everybody, but don't you think Republicans want better schools for black kids? Yeah, they do. How do you get there? With teachers unions in place? You can't. You can't. There is no path. While teachers unions exist in their current form, there's no path you can't get to improve school because you can't get competition. You can't fire bad teachers. You can't. You don't have school choice. You know you're not gonna be ableto use the, uh, use the listening religious school or private school or any any other school. Even if you could afford it. Just can't use them. They don't exist. So there's that. There's an obvious strategy for for making things better, which is to break the, uh, break the teachers union. Uh, of course, that has its problems. All right, there's a we'll talk about the speech of a minute, and there's a pundit on CNN Harry intern who believes that the rumored belief that they're shy trump supporters and that the polls are not picking them up. So Harry entered right suspending peace and see that and say that that can't be the case. It can't be true that Republicans air lying to pollsters because the way they're polled is with robo calls. So there's not a human being, and Harry ended. I don't want to insult the guy, but I don't know how to do this. I don't have to talk about this without insulting his intelligence. He thinks that because you gave your political opinion to a robo call that you're talking to a machine so you wouldn't have any problems with your privacy. Um, Harry, I would be really embarrassed to put that opinion in public because that robo call there was your phone number and it knows what answers you gave by pushing keypad or wherever you did it. And that's all of the database. You don't think a human has access to the database? How could you be? How could you be so unaware of the world to think that because a computer is collecting the information, the humans don't have access to it. So I can't think of a Republican who would trust a robot with their personal information. A robot comes to your door and says, Hey, I'm a robot. Can you tell me your medical information, You go. Are you kidding? That's private. I'm not gonna tell you by medical information. The robot at your door says No, no, no. About even a person of a machine. You can tell bay. Then the Republican says, Really, if I tell you that you know I still have privacy because your machine and the robot says, Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't lie to you. Then the Republican goes into his gun safe, takes out the biggest weapon he can. Hey, blows the head off the off the robot because it's obviously an evil robot, and I think it would be a justified killing. Um, so glad bite. It is 11 points ahead of these robocalls. Maybe. Maybe, you know, I don't think you could rule out the Biden is actually had might actually win the election. Good. Ever. So here's the biggest story of the day that will be treated as the smallest story of the day. But it might grow over time, as Joel Pollack pointed out, both by tweet and on Breit Bart where he wrote about it. What we saw last night was you noticed that the rally crowd was not that big. And of course, the campaign Trump Campaign tried to say maybe it was because protesters trying to keep people out. But it wasn't that the protesters did do do little interfering, but it didn't have anything to do with the final kempt. So what was it? They did it? Well, AOC and some of the Democrats are Oh, yes, they say crowing that they're quite happy that they believe there was a tic tac preg. In other words, users of tic Tac got together and they organizes Allied Camp Aid Teoh RSVP'd to the rally but not planning to actually go. So they were just going to say they were going. And then, you know, the campaign was saying we sold a 1,000,000 tickets or a 1,000,000 or SVP's, but that was all fake. That was a tic tac prank that started small and grew into a big thing. So AOC was laughing and mocking the the Republicans and the Trump campaign last night by tweet Ha ha ha! You fools! The clever, clever anti Trump users, the citizens, the young citizens. She called them the Sumers. You know, the young people of tic tac they organized this campaign, and they tricked you and they made your rally a failure. Ha, ha ha. Is that the story? Is there anything they think? Maybe a detail that could be added to that story that would make it a little bit different. Is there anything maybe missing from her tweet? Well, tic Tac. It's a Chinese company who controls the algorithm in Ticktock? Well picked up picked out guest inside what their album rhythm is. Oh, control stick duck Chinese government because they control any Chinese company that they haven't interested. If they didn't care, they wouldn't control him. But since TIC Tac is a gigantic social media company with a gigantic influence potential, that would be a case where you could know with with certainty that the Chinese government has some control over the tic tac algorithm. Let me ask you this. If you're familiar with TIC Tac, you know, it's mostly people doing funny little seen dancing videos. You know that that's 99%. And you know that the age it's sort of the 12 year old you sort of the core age a little bit older, but you know, 12 is probably that you know the real point. Now, can you remember in your, uh, in your, uh, memory of your entire life, Do you remember the other time that 12 year olds were really interested in politics? To the extent that they would care about one rally in Tulsa and that they would care so much about politics, these 12 year old Americans? Because, you know, your 12 year old American girls, I think, is mostly girls, 12 year old American girls. What they really care about is politics. And the issue they care about the most is the number of people who attended a trump rally in Tulsa because that's the sort of thing they care about when they're 12. Do you believe that? Do you believe that the, uh, that the size of this viral campaign was driven entirely by organic interest of 12 year old girls in politics? Is that what you think? Do you believe that this happened organically? It's possible, but it would be the first I've ever that 12 year old girls got deeply involved in politics. I would say the odds that this happened organically are pretty close to zero, which means that right in front of us. And by the way, since the the rally, crowd size has been front page news. So there's nobody who could argue that the story of how many people attended the rally doesn't have an effect on our political system. You couldn't claim that, right? Nobody Nobody reasonable could say, Well, that didn't have it. Influence of the campaign. It was such a small thing. Well, it is a small thing compared to all the other things. But it is nonetheless true that that we we watched right in front of ourselves, the Chinese government changing the news cycle of how we report on the biggest political decision of our lifetimes. Perhaps so, here's the thing. Uh, if TIC Tac is still legal in the United States next week, your government is fucking worthless. So I don't know that Tic Tac will be banned in the United States, but if it's still alive in a week, the government of the United States is just not doing the job. I mean, this was such an obvious of foreign interference, and I'll even go further. Suppose you can imagine the since you can't prove the Chinese government did anything, you know there's no smoking gun because we don't have access to the algorithm. Even if you couldn't prove it, what's the difference? What's the difference? You still have to shut it down because China could have done that. Whether or not they actually did it in this case is completely irrelevant to the question of shutting them down. This case shows unambiguously that they could have done it. All they had to do is boost the algorithm so that more people saw the saw The Post. That's it. How many people, How many people do you think would organically see a political post on tech talk? Do you think that's the kind of post that goes viral? Hey, I'm going to say something about politics on TIC Tac That'll go viral Will. Some of them are. But that feels like a new phenomenon. Like maybe there's somebody behind the curtain who say, Well, there's not much political on here, but we're gonna make these big So I don't know, there's no initiate this at this point, a tic tac has to be closed out. It has to be closed out because what we saw last night was worse than Russia. Collusion was even alleged way worse, you saw the, uh, Facebook ads that the Russians did like complete amateur Amateur hour had no effect on anything. I can guarantee it, but this Did this actually change the new cycle in real time? You watched it, you watched it. There's nothing else to ask. There's no further. No further investigation needs to be done. You know that they could have done it. So even if they didn't, it's too big of a risk. So I wouldn't be surprised if Tic Tac gets shut down by the end of the week next week. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets shut down on Monday, and I will tell you that if we go all the way into the election and Tic Tac is still legal in the United States, Trump doesn't deserve to get elected. So let me say it as clearly as possible. If Tic Tac doesn't get shut down before Election Day, I don't care if Trump wins it up. It means not doing the basic job of the president. If he lets that continue to be a product that they're sold in the United States or using the agency's Would you agree, by the way, when you say that's just so basic to the job. But if he's not, if you can't get that done, I'd look at somebody else. You got to start looking at the alternatives. If the guy who's in the position doesn't do something that basic, Um, all right, let's talk about how he did on the speech itself. I know that's what you care about my first take, and I tweeted about it. But then I deleted. My tweet is that it looked like a disaster. So the first, I don't know, 15 minutes seven or so I was. I was just thinking, This is the worst rally. He looks like he's trying not to win. That was my first impression. And here's some of the things that I saw for that, Uh, he said stuff like these are all red meat. He was feeding CNN. So my specific complaint is that it seemed like the entire speech was just to give CNN material to criticize him about stuff that just didn't need to be said. It just wasn't this wasn't helping him, but it could hurt him. That was my first impressionable. They'll tell you how that change. So you talked about the flu being the Chinese flu? I think he said the common flu flu. So you know that's gonna be called racist. He said he used the word hombre. You know what if some bad breakups and even singled to us that he knows he's not supposed to use that word. And then he used it after he signal is not supposed to. He, of course, supported statues, which people will interpret as racist, even if it isn't he used or two thugs that he knows people will interpret as racist, even though it isn't, Um so he did that we talked about his supporters would fight better if it came toe. If you gave to a Civil war, the Republicans would win because they're better fighters, basically. And the Second Amendment is important because of the protesters, which makes see, then think he's talking about shooting people. So and then of course, he had. I don't think he mentioned Juneteenth. He didn't mention any unifying words. Uh, the entire all of the visuals were Trump supporters back tightly together and not very wearing masks and frankly, look like idiots. Let me say that as clearly as possible, the visual of it in the in the middle of a pandemic, seeing crowds and crowds and crowds of picture after picture of Trump supporters standing shoulder to shoulder without Basques, it doesn't make them look like idiots. So it's just a terrible look, um, that I kind of expected that the president would not being wearing a mask, but that the participants would be strongly encouraged. Toe wear them. Some of the some of them had them, but really? So I would say that the If, yeah, I'm not sure how that played with Republicans. My guess is that Republicans generally liked his speech. You probably more like that than not. But even Trump himself referred to the first part of his speech is not up to his standard. He wanted to. He actually criticized the quality of his own this speech while he was giving it, and he was accurate, which made me laugh so so that so far we like about him like that. There's some that lack of a filter is very appealing, even though it has all kinds of problems associated with its just appealing to some types of people I would include myself. Um, but here's what he did, right? Um oh, another thing, he said. Jokingly or not. He said that all the testing makes it look like there's more infections, and that's bad for Trump. So he said he told his team toe, slow down the testing because it makes it look bad now. CNN chose to interpret that as literal. Like he actually been that, to his credit, Chris Cillizza Cillizza, who was on CNN in one of those you know, multi person panel shots when they went to bed, he said. And he said it explicitly. Well, I don't think he was completely serious about that. In other words, at least Chris Eliza recognize that when the president says things like this, you should always take them as literal. But the other Panelists shows two, because that makes it a story. But just knowing that Chris Eliza was like, I don't know that that's serious is helpful because you know that even see and then has gotta have a little bit of question whether he was joking by the way he was joking on that. He also said that he talked to the Republicans of the plane coming over some of the other politicians, and they were talking about how it might be better to let the city's bird because he would look good for job. And I thought to myself, Oh, God, did he really say that? Did he say the Republicans were talking about letting the cities burn because it be good politically? Did he really say that? But people also realise, because he also said that if the city's allowed him to, he could stop the problems in an hour if you'd have to send in the military. But he stopping an hour. So he is very clear that the reason that he's holding off is because the Democrat mayors air not letting him it. If they asked, he would come in to solve the problem. So here's boy overall. Take what I what Deferred first heard the first few things that I knew would be on CNN. I wrote them down and checked as soon as it was done. Yes, every point that you pulled out that you do what he said. It was like there is the CNN headline. There is another one is sure enough, everyone was there, but it wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I looked at the headlines last night, and there was they didn't use the word racist. What's up with that? He fed them intentionally Race baiting ideas. What the The great one was the one that told you what he was thinking, all right? Because that one was a little too on the nose. He actually said, I like to use the word obre and he made some reference to the fact that it would be trouble and that he used it. So here, if you look at all the things he said that normally other people would put in the context of racism, I didn't see it as strongly as I thought CNN was gonna play it. Because if you would look at all these things, they really more easily fall into being offensive. That free speech. So I think the president has carved out of a strong position, which he refuses to give an inch odd, which is free speech, which is a gigantic issue for his base and watching him not about even a little bit to political pressure about how to speak. I could like I kind of liked it, even though I was like, Oh, don't say that. Don't say that At the same time, the other part of my brain was say, I like the fact that he is. He's protecting the space meeting that he's He's absolutely adamant about the right to offend people about anything. He was the right to be offensive, and and he's fighting for it. That right accrues to his base. I think, by association in the sense that if he doesn't get cancelled, you know, that does have some kind of a standard now. There were no unified words. A lot of people on both sides say, Well, that was kind of a missed opportunity. But on the other hand, of the other hands, as we watched the Democrats, uh, self oblate, in other words, the autonomous zone is all bad news for Democrats. I would think, uh, the ongoing trouble. This seems like it's accruing to Democrats. The the year the the Democrats in the middle seemed to be losing ground to the left. This is the weirdest election, because the best campaign strategy for both bided and trump mr dot campaign is that weird. Biden is definitely advantaged by not campaigning, but so is Trump. I think Trump just has to wait and just just let the news play the news. Ah, lot of people have criticized him for not being more vocal about the protesters, the destruction, etcetera. If he had been were vocal, it would have been called racist. He didn't say all the right things about George Floyd etcetera. And he did do an executive order of, you know, police police processes. So he was paying attention. He was acting. He was saying the right things. But once he's done the basics, Hey, maybe just not talking This is best campaign strategy. I mean, that would be surprising if it were. I'm not. I'm not recommending it. But overall, I would say that the president gave a speech much like is less much like his other speeches. I don't think it will make a dent. It will not lose many votes. It will not gain him any votes. But here might be the one thing that we took away from it. That might be the one thing that was the most persuasive. Are you ready for here is the one most persuasive thing that came out of it, what Trump did in front of the entire world. Instead, out of he was there for an hour or whatever. It waas, whatever the time. Waas, huh? He did a one hour presentation that there isn't one person in the entire world who believes Biden could have done that. Nobody, There's no Democrat, and there's no Republican who believes Biden could have simply even performed the way Trump did. Forget about what he said. Just the performance. Trump was clearly mentally all there. He was a top of his game. He even made fun of his slow start. I think he's a little out of practice, got a little in a practice with the rallies and stuff because of the time off. I think that will fix. You know, I think you'll be better every time he doesn't uh, the slaughter meter is probably, uh, it's probably about 50 50 right there, so it's below 100% but it's also gonna be moving all over the place between now and election. Um, he was very funny. I think he had his funniest jokes when he talked about the rape and he had excellent presentation on the water glass and using his one handed the saluting and stuff. So in terms of playing to his base, I think it was very successful in terms of the, uh, the left. I know the protests seemed to fizzle out. The protests seem to fizzle out. Um, yeah, he was pretty funny. I had a good laugh over some of his stuff and I was watching the fact checker Dale, Is this the fact checker? So Trump claimed that the last 10 few the ramp he sort of your rand out and that if they showed the last part of the ramp, they would see that there's nothing wrong with Trump, that it was obviously the ramp because the last part he ran. Now, of course, he didn't left. That just didn't happen. If you look at the video No, there was no running down the ramp. Did that happen? But immediately after he was off the ramp, he did show a little spring in his step, and I remember seeing that even before he mentioned it. And I thought, Oh, that little spring in his step is I think he's signaling to anybody watching. There's nothing wrong with me. That's the rip. And when I watched it, that's exactly what I thought. Oh, that little He did a little like a skip at the end when he got off clearly showing they had full control of his body and his legs. It was just the ramp. So when Dale Fact checks it and says no, the last 10 feet of that ramp, he is not running and he said he was running and that's just not true. But if you watch the video, you're going to see him get to the end of the ramp and they do, like, do a little like skip thing. And then you could say OK, well, he did. He did exaggerate the end of the ramp thing, but it's also obvious that the do is live because he's fine, that he obviously there's nothing wrong with this. We can say have drinking water. I was very curious what the two hands on the water glass waas cause we've seen them do it before. He holds it with two hands, and his explanation was he's trying to keep a drip from his tie because it looks bad. If you get like a little drip on your tie it so tight it's really gonna show. And I thought, That is so weird. I think it's true. I I think it was so weird that it would be hard enough to believe that that he used the second he had to keep a drip office tie. I don't know that you would make that up. That would be the weirdest way of the world to make up. So as soon as I heard that, I thought, Wow, that is just so weird. That's probably true. All right, That's all I got for now. And I will, uh, I will talk to you later.
