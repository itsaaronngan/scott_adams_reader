Hey, in about a year today. Come on in. If I'm here, you should be here. Yeah, We got stuff to talk about. Yes, we do. And that will happen directly after the simultaneous. I know you'll enjoy it. It's gonna be a good one. Now, you might wonder why I don't do the normal introduction to the simultaneous of today. And there's a reason I can't remember it. That's right. I read it every single time. One of the tricks of writing is that things that you can read are very different than things you read out loud. So if you're going to write something for the purpose of reading it aloud, if you're going to be reading it, that's fine. But something you were gonna memorize and say you might write it differently. Um, but we're gonna enjoy the simultaneous sip right now. Do you have a cup? A mug? It's dopamine. Head of the day. The thing that makes everything better. And you're getting ready for it. Now go. Good stuff. So last night I was getting ready to go go to sleep, winding down. I was in bed and I thought to myself, I'll check Twitter one more time. 

Here's why you should never dio if you're trying to wind down and go to sleep, don't ever check Twitter right before you go to sleep. It's a very bad sleep strategy. And so I opened up Twitter and I see somebody's making a comment that's referring to the President Retweeting May, which he did the day before yesterday. And I thought, Oh, they're still talking about this. This is the day before yesterday But then I looked at the comments. Well, this doesn't seem like it's about that one. So I click on it and he had retweeted me again. So is the second Retweet In two days? I'm thinking well or an eye pretty special. And then I saw another one. I thought, Are you kidding me? He retweeted me three times in two days, but it wasn't true. It was not true that I got retweeted three times in two days by the president because it was four. They tweeted be four times in the last 48 hours. We'll talk about those, um, and I got to tell you it's the weirdest experience to get retweeted by the president because it's simultaneously big and small at the same time. So the big part is that used the most important politician on the planet. And even even if it were not just the job of the president, he's also the biggest personality in the biggest job. I mean, it's it's trump, right? And so when he when he when he tweets about you and he referred to me as interesting guy, I'm not sure if that's my forever name yet It doesn't have the crisp, insulting quality of his other dig names, so I don't know if I can call myself interesting guy. 

Just it just needs to be a little more insulting, So maybe I could ask him for that later. Can you give me a nick day in this just a little bit derogatory? Because I don't think you can go with this one. It's not gonna work a way. So that's the big part is that it's the biggest you know, the most important personality in the world, who was apparently I caught his attention to four times in 48 hours, so that's the big part. The small part is that what I'm experiencing it. It's just being my phone. Christie, it isn't in another room. That's just like, uh, just me and my phone. That's it. So it's the weird combination of things. And then I woke up in a lot of comments and other people's up, so we'll talk about those things in a minute. Um, I tweeted yesterday that if I ever become president, seems unlikely. But if I ever become president, I want to do such a good job that the news is about stuff like, uh, drinking water with two hands walking down a ramp, tweeting about stuff. Have you noticed that the criticisms about Trump or completely off topic of his job performance have you noticed that happens? Gotta subtly. Because we get so drawn into each story, it's hard to look at the larger trend. You get lost in the details, but if you just rise up for a minute and look at the headlines, let me call up. Let's just call up CNN randomly and see. You see the types of stories that are anti trump. Um, there's something about Briana Keillor confronts Tramp Trump campaign official saying, Are dead Americans funny to you? all right, so the best. The best they could do is that there's a campaign official laughed about a joke. Okay, here's another one. Trump takes first trip to the border, so that's a nothing. 

First trip to the border in 2020. Okay, how about fact checking Trump's male and vote fraud claims? All right, let's check that. So John Avlon is checking Trump's male in fraud clams and as his source, he uses PolitiFact. So your first to PolitiFact and they have this little logo. You've probably seen it that shows the meter going from your false to true. And if it's really false, it's like it's on fire. It is a lie. So politifact is their source for CNN to fact, check the president. So I thought to myself, Well, I wonder how credible they are, So I thought, I'll check the one thing that I know what the truth ISS, and it's the fine people hoax. And everybody who reads the transcript knows the truth. So this was easy. You don't have to wonder what the truth is, because it's just written right in front of you. There's no interpretation. It's pretty obvious, so you should go to PolitiFact, presumably if it's a credible outfit and it will have this little meter, which it does for all of its fax. And that fact will say the fine people hoax or the fine people story that the allegations of the president called the marching Nazis find people. It should have a big, flaming, false right. If if politifact is credible, that's what it would be. A. So I look it up and I'm looking for the logo and it's not there. It's not there. The logo, the little Flaming truth o meter is the primary branding thing that they did. They put it on every story. So every story has that, except for the fine people lochs instead of telling you it was true or false, they said, We're just going to show to you in context. Here's the transcript. Why would affect checking organization, not check the fact on the most important fact of the entire presidency? 

In my opinion, that's the most important fact, because more than anything, it's what's behind the imagination that the president is a obvious racist and everybody knows it. And here's the evidence, because this fine people looks think about it. PolitiFact left their fact checking off the biggest lie and politics didn't say it was true. I didn't say it was false. They just left it off. Think about that. And that's the source that CNN uses the fact check in. So, uh, they're The CNN claim is that mail in ballots would not be a massive fraud opportunity. They might be debating some of the details of that. And I would imagine the president is speaking approximately, uh, as he often does eso. He may not be true on every fact, but is there any thinking person who believes that mail in ballots are not and the opportunity for fraud? I can't even wrap my head around the opposing argument. I really can't. So that's weird. Um, here's what else they say. Trump falsely accuses Obama of treason. So again, here's one of the biggest. The worst criticism they could fight of Trump's job performance has nothing to do with his job. This is something you said about Obama in a political season, and he exaggerated, perhaps used treason when really meant bad behavior. You know, not technically, treason is not a story again. If I run for president and become president. 

The best you could Dio is to have your biggest critics have nothing to say about your actual performance on the job and only talk about your personality. Uh, talk about some unimportant things that you said that might have been wrong. That is that That's the worst they have on Trump. Are they talking about the economy? Do you know what November 3rd is gonna look like? Here's what November 3rd is gonna look like. The economy is gonna be roaring back at record percentages, which will be misleading because we're coming off a low base. So just as Obama's performance with the economy was misleading because he, too, was coming off a depressed base, everything looks good from there. Trump is going to get that same imaginary benefit he's going to be able to say, Hey, look, we had a Croat, a virus and things air up X percentage. Uh, sorry, says the Dow, is that they're screaming up that it is. So the president's gonna have an economy that's coming back. I don't think people will blame him for the president, for the economy being depressed, but they might credit him for it. coming back. I think that would be fair because he has been pushing for it to come back. Even that may be great risk for health problems. Um, and so the economy will look good. What else we got? Let's take China. How is the president? It'll look in terms of China trade. Well, I think China's reputation is so bad that because Trump has been tough, I'm China. In general, he's gonna look smart because he was tough on China. And it looks like his instincts about China have been completely proven true. Um, so that's what about Isis. Isis is gone. Isis is completely gone. Do you remember Isis? Wasn't there a time you were worried that Isis was going to conquer the world? It's gone basically. I mean, at least territorially, it will never be. Ghana's an idea, I suppose so. You can kind of go down the line if you're if you take whatever you think are the top five things, right, Take the top five issues. He looks pretty good. There was a Rasmussen poll that, uh, said that something like 24% of black likely voters, so it's not the entire population is just the likely voters who are also black Americans, strongly approve of their president's job approval. Do you believe that? So this is Rasmussen Rasmussen, I think, was the most accurate poll of the major polls the most accurate in 2016. And they're saying that, uh, about 1/4 of black likely voters approve or strongly approve of the president's performance. Do you think that's true? 

I think it is actually just anecdotally. And of course, you know anecdotally doesn't mean much, But it is my impression that he may have doubled his support in the black community. And why wouldn't he? Why wouldn't he? Right? Because I think the I think the black community is looking at the same stuff everybody else was looking at. Do you think the black community likes crime? No. Do you think the black community likes a bad economy? No. Do you think the black community likes, you know, bad trade deals? No. So, yeah, why? Why wouldn't he have doubled support, even even against all the bad press? Seems like you would have, um all right, some other things. So one of the things that the President retweeted was my tweet in which I was tweeting about. Shaun King. Now you all know showing kidding. He's he's an activist, one of most famous ones. And he's a black, Would you say is a black activist where he's an activist for black issues. Now, the reason I ask that is that the and I cant tell the story without this, All right, So when I start giving in this context, the first thing you should say is how is that relevant to the story? You're seeing her than the comments. So he's an activist for the black community who has the interesting distinction of not appearing to be black. Now, I'm not gonna I have no opinion of what his d n a is right. So I'm not gonna go there. I'm just saying that the public opinion, other people, not me looking him and say, Dude, you don't even look black. I don't think you black I don't know what he is. I'm not gonna give you an opinion on that. I just think it's it's a sort of obnoxious to tell other people what they are. So, uh, uh, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna get into that argument. I will simply simply note that the most famous Ling about Shaun King is that he's not black enough, according to his critics. Okay, And what I say, not black enough. I mean, he looks like a white guy again. Nothing wrong with that. I'm not saying his way. I don't know anything about his DNA. 

I don't even have an opinion. I don't care right. I literally couldn't care about any of that. But it's important to this anecdotal story here. So he was asked about whether the depictions of Jesus, who looks sort of white and European in most depictions if he thought that that needed to be changed to be more and historically accurate and, let's say, incorporating the assumption that Jesus was less European looking and probably more Middle Eastern looking. And this is what Sean King tweeted, he said, Yes, I think the statues of the white European, they claim is Jesus should also come down, meaning like the statues and stuff. They're a form of white supremacy, always have been in the Bible. When the family of Jesus wanted to hide and blend in, guess where they went. Egypt, not Denmark, tear them down so that was shown Kings Tweet. Now here is the fascinating psychological part of this. The fascinating part is that when you see this tweet isn't your first impression that the slippery slope, you know, started with one statue and then it was lots of statues. And then it's and that it's, ah, you know, Teddy Roosevelt. And, you know, and the next thing you know it's going to be Jesus. Is that your first impression that you started with something that wasn't that big? A deal was just a statue. One statue in the world full of statues. But there was lots of statues. And now it's my God, they're coming from my religion. That's what it feels like, right. But let me suggest that if this had been the first and only issue, if you've never heard about any statues, there was there were no protests going on. If the only thing you heard off was just this point. 

Hey, why is Jesus always depicted looking European? Wouldn't you think that was actually pretty reasonable as a complaint? Seriously, it was the only one. You were judging it as a continuation of something maybe you've got a problem with. If it was just by itself it isolation. It's actually the most reasonable. It's the most reasonable complaint, which is what I said. So when I retweeted showing kidding, I thought to myself, You know, um, you know, in these times of great division and stuff like this, I don't disagree with that, even a little bit. In fact, I thought that all of my life when I went to Sunday school as a kid, I'm 10 years old and I'm looking at White Jesus and I'm looking at the Middle East and I'm 10. I'm thinking, How does this work? How did you get this European guy born and born in the Middle East? So and then Shaun King's characterization of it says it's a form of white supremacy. Now, if you've been watching me for a while, you know that I've been, um, criticizing anybody who uses the word white supremacy because it's just hyperbole, and it's really not in a lot of the examples that people are using in terms of how white people are thinking about anyway has nothing to do with any of that. So I think most Lazar is overblown. But in this particular example, I've got to say he's got kind of a point here because religion is, you know, what's more important than religion and Christianity being one of the big too, I guess. Religions. It's super super important in the world and in people's lives. 

And sure enough, the racial identity of historical Jesus was changed to make it white like, How is that good, huh? And, uh, somebody in the comments is saying he was a Jew and they could look any number of ways. Well, I think that that's a fair statement that there people look all different ways, But I don't think anybody would disagree that the artistic renderings of Jesus were intended to look like a European. Okay, I'm not saying it's impossible that somebody could look a certain way, and it's different from the other people. But I think you would agree that they intended to make him European. Don't you feel that? That's a safe statement. I mean, I'm not a historian, but it feels like that safe, right? So I think Shaun King was just right, all right. I will be happy to criticize him in places where I think he's wrong, but why can't we just agree with him when he's right. And I think what's fascinating about this is if you take in the context away, you would say, Yeah, you know, it's pretty good point. Maybe maybe you should do something about that now. I'm not I'm not a believer. So it's not up to may. I'm not in this fight, that'll I don't. Whichever way it goes is fine, I think. I think everybody said just to see Jesus the way they want to, right? Like why, kid? Jesus, be exactly that. Jesus, you want to see? Why can't black people have black Jesus? Why can't Yeah, Why can't the Chinese have Chinese Jesus? Because he is Jesus, right? Not exactly fitting into, ah, you know, fitting into a little box. 

There's only one of them. So what? Whatever, Whatever the believers want to do with Jesus, that would be their business. Here is a horrible little story. So what's interesting about that is that the president retweeted my comment, which was which was also agreeing part of the comment was I said Trump just 1 2020 because if the protesters come after Jesus, that's the end of the election. is it now that the show on King thing probably will just stop with a one to eat? But imagine if you will, that it becomes a thing, even if I agree with it being a reasonable thing that they should be discussed. It is the end of the election. Is there anybody would disagree with that? That if this Jesus thing became more of an issue than it is more than just a tweet, it would be the end of the election. So President Trump retweets it. Do you see how clever that is? D zero clever. It is for the president to retweet that because it's in this form, is it waas just as a tweet? It's just blue check person who tweeted something that has been said before, not much to it, but because the president tweeted not only my comment that it would, that would basically be the election, but he also tweeted the part where I agreed with Shaun King. Think about it. If he didn't make your comment about it, you just tweeted it. So the fact that he would want to boost that signal because it's good for his campaign It's pretty clever I got to say that was that was a well chosen retweet. Uh, because if that gets bigger, the election's over. Um, years, I'll get back to us more Trump T retweets Admit there was an appalling story about something the New York Times did. There is one of the most despicable things you'll ever see in any entity. Uh, especially a news business. So the New York Times decided to do a story about a fairly famous blogger who conceals his real identity, and he blogged under the name of Scott Alexander. But that was actually his middle and his first and middle name. So is Riel. Last name. He keeps secret because he is a psychiatrist and he doesn't want his blogging, which could be a little more controversial. To bleed into his real work. He could give fired his his clients, whatever problem with So The New York Times says they wanted. They contact him to do a story about his blogging. Now I've talked about Scott Alexander's blawg before is one of the most brilliant and insightful things you've ever seen. Like ever. That's a pretty big statement, right, But it is one of the most insightful, smart, fresh views you've never seen before. 

I've quoted him before one of the most interesting thinkers in the world, really and very well informed. And The New York Times, of course, was to do a story about it cause you so influential and so good at it. But they decided they were gonna docks him. They were going to do a complimentary story about him, cause I guess the angle was he got a lot of stuff right about Corona virus before the experts did. So it's gonna be a complimentary story about how he got things right before the experts were. And he's an influential great blogger, and their policy is that they reveal real names. And of course, he asked them not to. And they said, Now it's our policy. We have to reveal real names now This they were going to write a positive story and destroy his life, intentionally knowing that we're doing it because it's just the policy. It's just their policy to use a real name. Yeah, we can't We can't make an exception because it's just our policy, and I don't know if there if they did, or they're going to I don't know the status of this. I can't tell if, but what at what it caused him to do was to delete his entire blawg. Not just a block post, but the entire history of his blawg, one of the most valuable contributions to civilization. And he deleted it. He kept the back up, so it's not going forever. But he deleted it and and wrote about it. Now I could not hate the New York Times more than I do right now. It's just evil. There isn't really any other way toe spend this. If you're telling me that The New York Times has a rule and they just can't break that rule Well, okay, but it's an evil rule. Do you know who else had a rule? Hiller? He had a rule to. They were very good rules. We wish he didn't have them. 

So New York Times, why don't you take your rules and shove them so far up your fucking evil ass is that we can see it in your eyes. You shouldn't even be able to stay in business after something like this because it's one thing to do something accidentally. Very forgiving about accidents. It's one thing to have a different opinion. I accept different opinions. It's one thing to be political. It's one thing to be hyperbolic. It's one thing to fail. The fact checking. There are lots of ways to have bad behavior. But Doc's ing a guy that you actually like in your writing story because of how much he's added to the world. And you know you're going to destroy his life by revealing him that is so fucking evil that I can't even wrap my head around it. Amazing on. By the way, this guy isn't political. There's nothing political here. He's literally just, ah, helpful voice in the world. That's it. And they're destroying his whole fucking life. Oh, it's worse than that because his patients will suffer. Is a psychiatrist with a big group of patients? Do you think that they will be unaffected by this? No, Now they will be affected. Fucking evil. All right, in the the other thing that's president Tweeted was just in article i retweeted, which was that the supposedly the only pollster to show Trump winning the state of Michigan. So, in other words, he has that distinction for accuracy in 2016 um, basically has a projection that's completely different than the major polls. So you know, the major polls are showing Biden winning by very large margins. 

And the guy who was the most accurate pollster on a state basis, at least for the some of the key states, says that his polling, using a little different methodology, which has been more accurate in the past, shows it's neck and neck. It's neck and neck, and he suggests that there might be mawr, uh, shy Trump supporters than 2016. That's right. It's neck and back. And there might be twice as many shy supporters who are not admitting who they're going to vote for than 2016. Uh, so the president retweeted that because that obviously is good for him? Uh, let's say, uh, Trump put a temporary hold on workers visas from foreign countries. You know, this is a topic I don't know a lot about, but I also don't understand why the tech workers are being treated differently than other kinds of workers. I could see wanting to keep employment good in this country if there were types of jobs that Americans could do and wanted to do. But in the tech world, bring bringing people in from other countries. Let's say, um, let's say India, if you bring in an engineer from India, does that subtract from America or add to Indian or add to America? Well, have you ever met any any tactical people from India? They're really good. I'm not saying that as a general statement that every person of India is a technical expert. I'm saying that I've met a lot of technical experts who were born in in India, and they're really good. They've started companies. Some of the biggest companies in the country. Uh, at least people were born in India started the biggest countries, not necessarily just worker visa people. But my understanding of economics is that the more people who have that kind of skill, the better the more the better. Because there's an unlimited demand. There's no limit to the number of people who have money. I would like to do a startup of some kind, and the main thing that's preventing them from doing that start up is that they can't find a a technical person to do. The technical stuff is the number one problem. 

You probably think the number one problem for startups is getting money, right? It's actually not. In my opinion, somebody might disagree with this. The number one problem is finding technical talent. If you get that right, you can usually get money, too. So I don't understand this, but I also haven't heard the full argument. Um, and it's a temporary restriction. We'll see if that becomes permanent through the end of the year. I want to read you how CNN is currently characterizing the Russia collusion, uh, coup against the president. So that's my characterization that the Russian collusion hoax was essentially a coup to remove the president. So that's the way I would call that. So CNN, of course, you would say to yourself, Well, they were certainly hugely embarrassed by covering it as if it were true for two years or whatever only to find out the entire thing was it was just a hoax and made up, and the president didn't do anything wrong. And it was bad actors in the government, etcetera. Exactly the opposite of was he intended reported for two years. So did they say, Gosh, we should got that wrong. No, This is the way they're deciding this is an opinion piece. Doesn't matter who it's under on CNN dot com. And here's their characterization of that. I just got to redo the Senate schools is hilarious. While quote while some misconduct related to the Russia investigations has been uncovered, that's just the first part of the sentence. Some misconduct. Yeah, there has been some misconduct a little bit in the hardly worth mentioning. You don't need any details, but it was up some misconduct related to the Russia investigation. It's been uncovered, and several former FBI officials have been chided for their handling of certain aspects of the probe. Chided, they've been chided. Now CNN does not say that the FBI did very, very bad things as part of what seemed to be a larger plot to remove the president was legally elected. No, they say this. Several former FBI officials have been chided. Oh, they've been chided. 

I don't even know where you come up with the word chided. Could you come up with a softer word to criticize somebody? Let me see if I can use these This word Joseph Goebbels, Goebbels, who was the Nazi propagandist? Um, a number of people have chided him for for some of the things he did. Yeah. Joseph got global. Said he was chided, got giant it a little bit. How about the whole team in, uh, killed millions of people? That's one way to say it. I mean, if you were being unkind, you'd say, Oh, yeah, he murdered millions of people. But if you are seeing, then you might say Hokey minute has been chided for some of the things he did in office while he was in power. All right, uh, let's say let's look about the bubble Wallace news story. So the news, if you can call it that, is that, uh, a rare NASCAR driver who's African American. Apparently they're not many of them, but a bubble. Wallace Ah claims that there was a noose hanging in the garage that you know, he part of the garage where his car was, I guess, And that was considered a racist act. And the NASCAR people got behind him and really supported him, which which was good. Now, I said to myself on Day one, How many of you remember? Can you back me up on this? Because a big part of what I do is that make predictions based on persuasion, and then I check them. Right? Have I told you that you have to check your protect predictions? Because otherwise you have no idea. You have no idea. Oh, how well you wonders to end the world. You don't know how your filter on the world works unless you make predictions and then check. Aided. What was the first thing I said when I heard about the bubble Wallace news story in the comments, What was the first thing I said? Where is the picture? Right. I told you that if there's no picture, it's a hoax. We live in a world where were bristling with camera equipment. 

Every single person, every one of you has a camera within arm's reach. Probably your phone, right? Are you telling me that people saw a frickin hoax? I'm sorry that they saw a noose hanging in the garage of a black NASCAR driver and nobody took out a phone. Really? Nobody took out a phone. So that, um So let me ask you this. Who else told you at the beginning of the story that if you haven't seen the photo already. It's probably fake now I have to say, probably because if this is, if this turns out to be a real story, let me be the first to say it's appalling. You know, it's It's a 10 10. It's like a cross burning on your loan. We all condemn it. There's no no hesitation, no equivocation. Horrible, horrible act if it's true, but without a photo. So 203 uh, race stories like this turned out to be false, according to The Wall Street Journal. Actually, two out of three it was researched. So the odds are that any of these stories have a 67% chance of being false. If you don't know if you don't know for sure, and you can't check it out yourself, that's the filter you should put on it. Well, be terrible if it's true, but there's a one in three Chance is true. So there's been some of you are saying in the comments already. Some people looked into it, and it turns out that there are photos and even live video, which is much harder toe fake. It's it's possible that you could do it, but it's harder. There's video of that same garage with that, with a pole rope for the garage doors or rope hangs down and you grab it and you pull it to raise and lower the garage. I have exactly that in a utility garage where I have a rope that I pull. Do you know what makes it easier? Toe? Pull that rope. Just take a guess. 

What would make it a little easier toe to grab the rope? Yeah, you put a little loop on the end and their actual videos from November November of that same garage garage number four with the pull rope from the thing hanging down. And they're in miniature about the size of a hand, not the size of the neck, not the size of something that could go over ahead. But more like the size of something you put your hand through. That was noose like at the bottom. Now, if I hadn't seen it on video because somebody was just filming back in November and they were just filming the cars and they go right by and you see that you see the thing hanging down and it's obviously just a pull rope for the garage now, uh, somebody cut it off. Allegedly so that there are no photos that you could take now because it was cut off. But back in November, you could you could see it. And it was clearly just a poor up. So that's the biggest one of the biggest stories in the country. It is just so obviously debunked once you see the video. But how many people will see the video? What percentage of the cup of the country do you think we'll ever know that that was that? That that's fake. Well, let's look at, say, CNN because, uh, see, funny, that story seems to have disappeared from the front page. Just jacking. Checking. All right, well, let me do a search on CNN and see if they've got any kind of story. So all this new story since three updates, Uh, Nope. That story seems to have disappeared. I just did a search on CNN's page, and this story isn't even there. It doesn't exist as any kind of the story in a search, unless they come up in the wrong order, will see. Oh, it is there. But it came up in the wrong order, right? I'll just quickly look at it and see if it mentions if it mentions even the possibility that there are videos of this in the past. Love a blood. People looking into it strengthens our resolve. It's a horrible thing. He set the race. Bubba, Bub, It's a despicable act. This will not break me. Um uh. And by the way, somebody pointed out that the garages in question have these multimillion dollar cars and tools of them. Of course, they have video. You know they have video because because it's like super expensive equipment and all these garages. So there's video of all this, so we're going to know for sure. Uh, Phelps would now say What if any, video cameras may have been recorded at the track, so the official won't say if there was video recording. Why would you not say that? Is it for security purposes? 

No, It's because somebody looked at the video and they know that there's nothing. There's nothing there. Uh, people are enraged. Yeah, okay. The sick person who perpetrated it must be found and exposed. Yeah, So CNN does not make any reference to the fact that there exists video on YouTube, which shows it in November as a temple. Do you Do you think that they auto at least mentioned that other outlets are treating it differently? So this is the world you live in? Where in the world is presented you as completely, I think. All right. So give credit to the last refuge that I think did the most thorough job of showing photographs before and after and debunk it. But there are other sources for that, but the last refuge seems to have been all over it. All right, Um, that's about all I want to talk about today. Um, some view. So my ring I'll just say again, just for the purposes of completeness. I was supposed to get married with Cristina in May, but Corona virus delayed that, and we re scheduled and rescheduled, and we were trying to figure out honeymoon and wedding date. And finally we decided that we would just call ourselves married. We will actually get married within next 30 days, probably. Um but we decided that the government doesn't get to decide if we're married. You know what I mean? It's one thing to say. OK, there's a process. Everybody has the same process. You have to go through these things and then you're married. My that If it's easy, if it's traditional, if the bride wants it, if the family wants, I don't mind doing any of that stuff. But if the government is preventing me from getting married because you know there's a Corona virus and it's just harder, I mean, it took us a long time just to get the paperwork to get the license, because nothing is easy. You know you can't go to the office in person and you got to do things in the mail and there's a website, but it doesn't look like it worked. So you're not really sure if again, through then you have to get a person who takes it in person down there for you and signs. It's like they've made it unnecessarily complicated. But does they might know why the ceremony matters? Does the ceremony matter just because you have a witness? I mean, I could get I could get a witness to sign. The document doesn't need to be a ceremony, so here is the point. 

Here's my point. I don't believe the government gets to tell me if I'm married. Do you agree with thing? Would you agree that the government is not in control of whether I am married? I'm married. That's it. So it's not the government's decision. I don't want their opinion on that. When things are back to normal, as soon as we can do this ceremony, we'll do it. So we'll wrap up the details. But don't tell me I'm not married. I'm just not legally very. Somebody says, Why, at your age, getting buried just days? Domestic partners? Well, there are lots of reasons, but one of them, a lot of it has to do with the level of commitment here showing to each other, etcetera. But a lot of it is financial, right, Because you want toe, you're both committing yourself. And you have to know that there's a financial, you know, safety for both of you, etcetera. So that part is common sense. You have you have to get get that taking care of. But the other part is just, um, existing in a world that requires labels. Yeah, the optics of it is exactly a somebody say the ability to say somebody is my wife is really convenient. It's really easy. It's clean. It says everything you need to say all those other words for it. And this is my domestic partner. Well, uh, just it seems to minimize the other person and just take something away from it. So of course, it's a considered decision, but there are some just advantages to it. Just makes everything a little bit cleaner in our current system. About my prenup, of course. Yes. Prenup is just pretty much, um, standard standard business if you're my age and you have assets, um, if somebody's asking about divorce and division of assets No, don't worry. I'm an adult. 

I live in the real world. I know all the I know all the risks. And we do what we we needed to do on. Oh, Did Project Veritas drop a new video? How about that? Let's look at it. Don't go away. Don't go away. The best part of this periscope just happened. All right, So remember I told you, uh, last week that there would be some major red pills dropping, and I said, It's not one story. It's gonna be like a quilt in which they will be squares of the quilt, which will be dropping from the sky. And what are these squares? May have just dropped was a, uh, with a Facebook, uh, project Beria tests and see what comes up. Ah, Project Veritas Explosion, CNN and Facebook. Is this the new one? You know, that's the open. Let's see what project. Very tests has going, uh, projects fair to us. Why is this not coming up? All right, Looks like this is Do it. Do it. All right, We'll talk about this tomorrow, but give me a chance to look it up. Uh uh. 6 23 years daily color Has it project Veritas video shows, Facebook content. Moderators discussing censoring conservatives reveals quote exception given to Don Lemon for hate speech. So, um, let me let me play it for you. Have you heard it? We'll replay it for you. You don't have to see the faces because they're all sort of semi concealed stuff. Let me know if you get here as you say be bring. I am more brave than I am. Scared of any trouble that anybody could get me for breaking some stupid nd eight. I think the truth is more powerful than any India to stick up for the voice of the people. Vince. Yeah, it's what Victoria Square. And they clear that people's content do things up because it's been details about cute. It's a very progressive company. Was very and Bride magazine. If you see a conservative get rid of Zach. McIlroy came to Project Veritas because of what he saw at his job. Facebook in Tampa, Florida He saw and filmed evidence of structural and cultural bias inside Facebook, discriminating against Republicans and conservatives. McIlroy story raises serious doubts about the under oath testimony of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to Congress, where he claimed Facebook has no political bias. What percentage of the flag posts in the Civic harassment Q as it's cold were Republican conservative? I saw a stark contrast between Republicans versus Democrats in the queue. 

I saw upwards of 75 to 80% of the post in that queue were from Republican pages, politicians, journalists and pages that supported the president or supported conservatives. What does that tell you about Facebook slash cognizance algorithm here? Well, certainly the algorithm is not human, but it had to be made by a human. So for 75 to 80% of the post to be targeting Republicans and conservatives because I it was a pot. But somebody had to design that algorithm. So really, somebody at Facebook Some people on Capitol Hill have expressed interest in this, uh, ratio that you speak of. Are you willing to potentially testify under oath that that 3/4 of the post he saw flag were in one political direction? To the best of my knowledge and ability to meet censorship online is one of the biggest issues facing us in the lead up to the 2020 election. Well, in so faras, I was not somebody who was working behind the scenes on policy, but rather as someone who was enforcing policy. I saw everybody around me and I saw myself and I did a little bit of comparing when I thought, you know, they really are not very many conservatives here, and because they're not very many conservatives, I really don't think there are very many people sticking up for the voice of conservatives at a company that handles all the at a company that handles the flow of conversations. Basically, the a large portion of the discourse online, and we're essentially in charge of what gets said, what gets stifled. You mentioned the election, and the kids can talk a little bit more about your concerns as it pertains to Facebook meddling were being involved in the 2020 Election. Well, we know publicly and as someone, even before I started working there, we saw plenty of. We've seen plenty of statements from Mark Zuckerberg publicly about how they don't want to meddle in the election. 

They want to give everybody a free, you know, the platform for you to speak freely. But we know that privately, they have very different opinions. And we've seen that with the previous Facebook story that you guys published. And I had no doubt that what he said publicly is not what he means to do privately. Let's go to the Trump cartoon. This one here is this something you I It's a little longer than I thought it was gonna be, but I will call your attention to it and say you should go watch it because today today might be a lot different than you thought it was gonna pay. So, um, I think you're gonna find out a lot in this video. I haven't seen it all, but, uh, it's gonna be a fun day. All right? That's it for today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
