Hey everybody, come on in. It's time for coffee with Scott Adams. I hope you'll ignore this probably racist symbol on my shirt. I haven't checked the news today, but if triangles can be racist, pretty sure checkmarks are next. We're coming for you, checkmarks. Well, if you'd like to enjoy today's coffee with Scott Adams. What do you think? You need to do it. Yeah, that's right. Coffee or a beverage of your choice and all you needis a cup [?] a flask a vessel of anykind. Fill it with your favorite liquid. I like coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure, The dopamine hit of the day, the thing that makes everything better. It's called the simultaneous sip. It happens now go. Oh, so some days the news is funnier than other days, and I love it when I wake up to a day of nothing but funny news. It's all funny today. I'm pretty sure this somewhere in the world there are tragedies and deaths, but the news no longer cares about that stuff. We're into the racist baby stuff and more fun. 

All right, so here's some things that are not covered in the news. Today is a very telling. What exactly is going on with the coverage of the protests? Did they stop? And if they stopped, is that news? Or they just planned them for the weekends because it's easier to do, on weekends. So I guess whether there are plans for violent type people to show up at the Trump Rally in Tulsa, how do you think that's gonna go? I've got a feeling Tulsa is going to be pretty lit now. One of the things is really tough for the anti Trumpers is that every time you see footage on television of Democrats destroying the world and then you're gonna juxtapose that to the president in front of a packed stadium full of law abiding citizens? Yeah, I'm starting to wonder if Biden even needs to run anymore. 

I really will talk about the polls in a little bit. But, how does anybody get their side elected if their team wants to show nonstop violence as the alternative to Trump? Basically, I mean, you could see that happening at the same time. So it's not the alternative, but it's gonna feel like it. It's gonna feel like two teams. One is setting your business on fire, and the other team is trying to make America great again or whatever. It's gonna be a tough one, and it makes me wonder if the networks are gonna have to not cover it. How is CNN? I'm going to cover this because if they show it, it's just gonna be all bad. Visually, it will be just devastated. And I think that the public's flexibility or understanding in terms of protests and violence started out very flexible because everybody was shocked about George Floyd.

And if you saw somebody acting out because of that, you would say to yourself, Well, I wish they wouldn't, but I kind of get it. You know, you sort of understood. At least even if you wouldn't have done it, you could say, Yeah, you know, I can see how that could happen. But the longer it goes, the less [understanding] that you have. The protesters are especially since there were lots of suggestions that have been floated and everybody seems to be taking them seriously. So that should be good news. But it won't stop the protests in Tulsa. I would expect a good deal of violence when that happens unfortunately. 

So I put up a little poll on Twitter and I ask this question knowing that all digital trails are discoverable and that you could lose your job in your family for supporting Trump, would you tell a pollster if you plan to vote for Trump? Of course, these are highly unscientific polls, but the only the only thing you can really tell with the Twitter poll is does there exist a lot of people who have a certain opinion. You can't even really know if it's more or less, because is that unscientific? But you could tell us there are a lot of them. I mean, that we come across pretty clearly by a ratio of about 2 to 1. Last I checked, two people said they would not talk to the pollster for everyone that would. Two people said they would either lie to the pollster or not give them an answer. For everyone that would, you might say to yourself, Scott, Scott, Scott, there's been polling forever blah, blah, blah. We had the same problem, you know in 2016. Trump was unpopular than Oh, no, it's not the same. It's not even close to the same as 2016. In 2016, Did you think you would lose your job for being a Trump supporter? I mean, I'm sure people did, but it probably wasn't the top thing you were worrying about, right at the moment. In 2020 it might be the top thing you're worrying about. There may be people all over the country who are saying, Oh, God, I hope somebody didn't see that tweet I did two years ago. I could get fired. So at the moment, the fear is real. 

What have I told you is the most motivating persuasion bar none. Nothing is more persuasive than this one thing here. Fear. Fear is always the most persuasive because you have to protect yourself first before you can do anything. You can't eat if you think you're gonna get killed right away. So, given that a real fear, this is not hypothetical, there is an actual real fear that you could lose everything. Your friends, your job, etcetera. So I don't think we've ever had a polling situation that was this, you know, rife with possible mischief, out of office mischief. So much is that in itself, self preservation. 

Here's the other thing that changed four years ago. Were you as aware as you are now? Of course you were aware. But there's a difference between knowing something is true, sort of intellectually, and having it just forced to the front of your brain, where your brain can't see anything else that's really different. In both cases, you knew it was the case. There's there's no new information, and I'll tell you what I'm talking about the moment. But there's a difference between just knowing it's true and just having it overwhelm your brain. You'll act differently in those two cases, and what we've watched for the last four years, especially with the Russia collusion stuff, is that absolutely no digital trail is safe. No database cannot be hacked, no server cannot be hacked and we've seen a complete willingness of people to share and dox people. 

So the things that are really different you always knew the government could find out anything, right? You knew they could track your phone. You knew that on some level they might be collecting all of your digital data, etcetera, but it wasn't front of mind. But if you turn on the TV and every single day, there's a new story of somebody's email text message, you know, data got hacked every frickin day. That knowledge that used to be just something you knew is now lighting up your whole brain like your brain is on fire with the idea that there's no privacy for digital communication is true. There is no privacy. I said this before, the only privacy that we'll have in the future is being boring. If you're boring, nobody wants to look at your stuff anyway. So being boring is literally the only protection you'll have that you can feel confident about. So long as nobody cares about you they won't look at your stuff. But even then, of course they would. 

I've got a question for you. Has the Supreme Court just turned into a popularity poll? I'll ask you this question because I don't really follow the Supreme Court. You know, I just follow the headlines when they're in it. But can somebody who knows something answer this question? When was the last time the Supreme Court had a ruling that went against popular opinion? Let's say popular opinion had to be at least 55% in favor of whatever position, whatever the topic is, doesn't matter. But when was the last time the Supreme Court voted against the public majority safe? I know because I feel like I feel like it stopped happening. I'm not entirely sure it matters. Honestly, I actually don't think it matters. Someone says, Roe versus Wade. I doubt that's true. Could be Brown versus Board of Education. You have to go back pretty far. Somebody says the travel ban. I don't know about that. All right, well, there's some questions. There might be some that were lesser issues that people were too worked up about, and then maybe in those cases, the court feels safe to go against it. But I feel like there's some kind of weird self preservation happening with the Supreme Court. While all of our institutions have lost their credibility, I feel like the Supreme Court might be trying to. And again, this is mind reading. So remember, I always warn you, you can't know what people are thinking. You just can't. You know, they could tell you, and they may or may not be telling you the truth. But you can't know what strangers air thinking. It's just not a thing. And but we can speculate. You know, there's something this that makes you scratch your head and say, I got some questions. Somebody says Obamacare. 

I've seen lots of examples go by, but, um, but let me just put this proposition other. The Supreme Court might need to maintain credibility, even more importantly than getting a decision, right? What, do you agree? That's true. Yeah. You know, if your chief justice or any of the members of Supreme Court would your priorities be that the most important thing is to maintain the credibility of the court itself, independent of what the actual decision is, because I feel like that is the priority, meaning that if I heard that was their priority, I would say how, Yeah, you know, when you think about it, it probably does need to be the priority because the way that the court can maintain its credibility is, of course, going with the majority. That's probably better than going with the minority, right? If if the court decided with the minority of the public, I don't know, it could last. Alright, It's got to be with the public at least often enough on the big stuff that the public says how I don't like all of your decisions, but usually you're with the public. So no, that's not how the public should think right. The public should not judge the credibility of the court by whether it agrees with what they would have done. That's the worst way to judge them. 

What we do, because we're not very sophisticated overall, and so we look at the court and we say, well, it disagreed with me 3 or 4 times. I guess they're not credible. That's exactly what you think. You would think that they had no value at all if they did their job perfectly, follow the Constitution, followed the law and just just interpreted that law if it didn't agree with your opinion and you'd say they were not credible. So I've got a feeling that the court is always balancing these two competing and very, very important issues. Because if the Supreme Court lost its credibility below, let's say some, there's probably something hypothetical support level beyond which the institutions in trouble. I think they've got to stay above the line and every day with that and they might have toe, you know, nudge a decision toward keeping their own credibility. If it's an old close now, I'm not suggesting that they do that consciously, but I would if I were on the Supreme Court. I would say, quite reasonably, I don't think there's 1/3 guy reasonable about this. I would say, You know, the worst thing that could happen is to lose the trust of the public in the Supreme Court, because the Supreme Court they end up being the tie breaker for a lot of stuff. If you lose your If you lose all your credibility, you know there's always criticism. But if you lose all of your credibility and you're the tiebreaker, that's pretty dangerous. It is dangerous because what do you do? I mean, if you don't have that ultimate credible tiebreaker? So if I were on the Supreme Court, I would sometimes do things just to remain credible, even if it wasn't exactly where I think the law is pointing because it is a greater good. I think there's a case to be made for that. 

All right, I provocatively tweeted the other day that in this election your votes will not matter. Here's what I mean by that, These are some things we can predict with complete certainty. We can we know with complete certainty that there will be allegations of vote rigging. Both of left and of the right. Do you agree? So far, we are all on the same page. There's 100% chance that both the left and the right, no matter what the outcome, independent of the outcome, both the left and right will have examples, or at least allegations of election tampering, election, you know, suppressing the votes of black voters, for example. Now, whether or not these are good examples, whether or not they really happened, whether or not they're true or not doesn't matter. They will be believed. 

Do you agree with me so far that when the Republicans have whatever allegations you know they're gonna have, the Republicans will think, Well, that's probably true. And it might be true because they'll be based on anecdotes and specific stories could well be true. You know, the left will have their anecdotes and stories, and they'll be able to point to things. And, you know, the left will completely believe it. Just like the right completely believes their side on pretty much everything. So we're gonna have the situation where there's a guaranteed question about the result. Probably we've had this sort of complaint every election from the beginning of time. Probably there is never an election of national election in which there isn't at least somebody saying it was rigged. Or at least somebody is pointing in a problem pretty much universal. And we always get by it right? It seems like it doesn't stop the system a little bit of complaining, but I will live with the result anyway, because there, because overall the system is credible. You know, Americans do pretty much trust the voting system, even though it's got all these irregularities. 

That's what it used to be. I don't think that's the case anymore. Here's what changed the ability of the press, the media manipulators behind the curtains, the ability to ramp up people's emotions is that a super weaponized level, even way beyond where it was in 2016 I would say that we've advanced a lot, really a lot in our ability to set people's brains on fire and make them mad or excited or afraid or anxious for greedy or something. So what we're going to go into is a situation where there's 100% chance that the left we'll feel let's say that they lose, they lose. Let's say Trump gets elected hypothetically, what will the left say? They'll say the vote was rigged, of course, because the polls will say it couldn't have happened. You see where this is going? The polls will say it's not possible. So if Trump wins and there's widespread allegations, there always will be of election tampering. What will the left do? They'll stage a coup. Now this is again a safe prediction. Why? Because they already staged a coup? Several. 

In fact, it's nonstop coup stuff. You know, the impeachment was a coup. The Russian collusion stuff was a coup attempt. The 25th Amendment stuff is a coup. All of these anonymous alleged bullshit books about what really happened in the room with Trump. They're all coup attempts. They're all coup attempts. They're, just in many cases, completely legal. Just because I call it a coup, don't assume it's illegal. They're just using every lever, every button, every mechanism, just there, throwing the kitchen sink at it to take a men of office without the benefit of a vote. Now I'm going to use the word coup to mean removing a president in any mechanism other than just a normal vote. So will there be a coup if released a coup attempt? If Trump wins the election and I would say the answer is 100% there's really no chance it wouldn't happen. Does anybody even disagree with that? I don't see any. 

I can't imagine anybody would disagree with that statement. Now, we don't know what it would look like. It could be another massive fake news story. I could be like Russia Collusion, where the British government runs an operation against the United States, and we blame it on Russia. I didn't say that. Just ignore that last sentence. Didn't happen. Go on with your business. Nothing to see here. Um, so it could be something like that could be completely different. But one thing that it might be is violent. In other words, the protesters are doing this giant test to see if you can flood the streets with people that make a difference. And apparently it does. It works, you know, they're willing to burn down the whole country. So Trump will be in an interesting situation, which is, if he has to use force to stop a coup which won't look like a coup and just look like demonstrators calling him a racist. 

That will be interesting. I think that's where we're heading in all likelihood. So my my current estimates are 100% chance that Trump will be re elected unless something big changes between now and Election Day. Will something big change between now and Election day? Of course it will. Are you kidding me? Something big will change next week and the week after the week after. So these guys and predictions are kind of useless because they're straight line predictions. In a world that can't know straight line, the world doesn't even know how to go in a straight line. And then I predicted that if Trump is elected, there's a 50% chance that the coup will succeed. I think there was a 50% chance that the Russian collusion thing or the the Ukrainian thing or some other thing could have succeeded. I think there was a good 50% chance it just didn't go their way.  

One of the funniest stories is @CarpeDonktum did a meme video showing some footage of some toddlers. I think they might have been three years old. I can't tell the ages of little kids, and but they are barely can walk kind of toddlers. And one was white and one was black, and they were best friends and they were hugging on the sidewalk and then they happily go running down the street. Now what @CarpeDonktum did, which was brilliant. He showed that in reverse order with the clips without the part where the kids are obviously best friends, hugging each other and loving each other. Instead he shows them running down the street. But because the little black toddler had started first, it could be interpreted as if the little white toddler is chasing the black. See if you didn't see them hugging just before that. Now the funny part is that so, @CarpeDonktum adds a fake Chiron. You know that the words at the bottom of the screen to make it look like it's a CNN report and that the Chiron says, you know, white baby chases, black baby or something like that. And here's the funny part, I've told you this before. The perfect prank is one that only the victim of a prank can't tell it's a prank. 

-- EDIT break 6/19/2020

That's what makes a joke really good, right? It's one thing just to mock people. In the years of funny picture, you know that sort of one dimensional. But if you can come up with the perfect prank, only the subject of the prank can't tell it's a prank. And the reason is they can't tell parody from reality. And if you can find somebody who literally can't tell the difference between reality and parody that you do a prank, that's a parody and they just can't tell. But everybody else can tell, because they're not [?] in the same way. So when I watched it, I honestly I couldn't even imagine how anybody would think this was true. It's so obviously not true that I just registered a joke, and I laughed at it. I would guarantee that close to 100% of Trump supporters and Fox News watchers would look at that video and immediately, immediately go Ha, ha! It's a joke, probably 100%. But The New York Times and CNN and all the fact checkers had to fact check it for their audience. I'll betcha there was not one conservative publication. That fact checked it because they didn't have to fact check this this statement. So here's my statement. 

There probably was no conservative publication that even it didn't even occur to them, to fact check it. Why would they? Because they don't think anybody wouldn't be confused by it. Of course, they cover the story of the others. Fact check yet, but I think The Washington Post, CNN, The New York Times I don't know how many people in the left fact check this thing, but just stop and pause for a moment that there were enough people on the left who thought it would be believable way, way for this. Who thought it would be perfectly believable. The CNN would run a story video of two toddlers chasing each other, one chasesthe other and call the one toddler a racist baby. Now their audience apparently thinks that's possible, which is frickin hilarious. So of course I got pulled because you got labeled by Twitter for being misleading. Perfect. You got fact check everywhere. Perfect. It got tweeted by the president. 

-- EDIT BREAK

Perfect. It became a national story. Perfect. Um, and it was short and, you know, sometimes means could go out a little bit too long. That's my only complaint about the political beams. I like him a short. This was just the right length perfect visual. And part of the reason I think they were complaining so much about it is that it was really powerful visually, when you when you watch the the two kids hugging you could just feel their joy, these air two little kids or really, genuinely happy to see each other. I mean, they really like each other, and it immediately reminds you that that's how you started, right? Like you immediately go to your baby self and say, Oh, yeah, there probably was a time, nothing. Remember it right? But there probably was a time that I couldn't even tell the difference between black people and white people. Like I didn't even know it was important. Just it wasn't a variable. Everybody looks different somehow. Why was I gonna pick out that one difference? It didn't occur to me. 

That was my friend, Bob. So So is really powerful the way it works on your mind. So this isn't just a funny mean. It's hilarious, is well crafted, its right size got the president's attention, Got national news, got a controversy about it, got removed from a lot of places. You can't you can't hit a longer long ball in that. So this one I, I will elevate to masterpiece status. If they were giving awards for means, this would be your Academy Award for 2020 eso. Congratulations to carpet Duncan. Um, by the way, if you're not watching a carpet dunked in his career, how it's sort of evolved from the first election, it's really fun to watch because he, as well as many others, are just putting together their talent stacks and just watching it come together. It's just it's just fun to watch. It's a great show. Speaking of art and speaking of masterpieces this next, this next thing I'm going to tell you is may be the hardest thing I've ever tried to communicate. I spent I spend probably 30 minutes last night trying to compose a tweet of this topic, and in the end, I sort of gave up because there's some things that, by their weird nature, can't be explained by some people, in other words, is something you could explain easily. But I can't. Here's the situation you've probably seen on Twitter. 

Akira the Don. Um, his user name is at a K i R a T H E D O N and he makes music. One of the things he's made, and it was a little clip that he's released is he's taking  the audio from my periscopes. And he's taken selected clips from audios, especially of the periscopes, that air, not political, so that there's nothing political in the music. But when I talk about the user interface for reality, for example, and he put it to music. Now here's why I couldn't compose the tweet because I need more time to talk about it like I'm going to do now. If I just told you that somebody who's music you're not familiar with necessarily I had put my audio from my periscope to music. What would be your first impression of how good that would bay? Not very good, right when that beers at your assumption, your first assumption would be, I don't know if I want to listen to that. I mean, maybe for curiosity, but it's not gonna be like art music, right? It doesn't make any sense. You're gonna be surprised. 

All right, now, here's the part that I couldn't tell when I listen to it. It actually just blew me away, but I couldn't tell if it's because I was listening to my own voice because think how powerful that would be to hear yourself talking to yourself in a way you weren't expecting. So you don't know what's gonna come. You know, it's because the order of it and the presentation was new to me as well, even though it's my words it was somewhat new to because of the way was composed. So I wasn't sure if if what was happening is I was just having a personal experience that would not be in any way generalized to other people. So I tweeted it out, saying as little about it as possible because I couldn't describe it and I wanted to see what the comments were. It turns out people really like it. People really like it, and I was trying to figure out why, and I'll take my best crack and, um, you know, you've seen you've seen the popularity of mash ups where you'll have, let's say, a rapper be doing, you know, some kind of wrap a part of the song, and then maybe Rihanna or somebody would come in and do more musically I don't know. 

I don't have the musical terms, but, you know, I'm talking about so you'd have somebody on a completely different style of rapper style. Mixing with somebody was more classically, you know, a singer. And so how is better? I don't know why, like I thought about it for a long time. Like, why is this better when you put two completely thing different things together? Doesn't quite make sense, but it iss I mean, I listen toe can't that's better in Illinois, and I think it has something to do with. In that case, you're waiting for the part you're waiting for. That might be some anticipation about it. Auto, maybe some context are contrast That makes it makes it, I think. But what I listen to this here's my best guess about why I had an effect on me. Um, as you don't. I'm a trained him to just and a very experienced communicator. So when you hear my words, but they tend to carry more weight than an untrained communicator. So if you send yourself, it's just somebody talking and they put it to music. You wouldn't be this because even when I hear myself. Sometimes I played back my periscopes. Just see if I can learn anything, you know, improve them. And when I'm playing back my own periscopes, you know, I, uh I see the density in them that I didn't know I had when I started. 

So when I was doing it, I wasn't aware of it, but I wouldn't watch it. I could watch it like a spectator. And I think, Well, it's pretty dense. But also, I realized that I'm using massively, and I don't even do it consciously. The techniques of hypnosis is so well that I don't think that was his intention to make a hypnosis slash a musical product because everything I do is sort of infused with persuasion that the little clips of my voice, you know, forget about them. Musically, they just activate a different part of your brain. And so what you're feeling is that the text is activating one part of your brain while the music is activating another. And there's two parts of your brain that you just don't activate at the same time. And that's why it has a weird effect on you because you haven't had those two parts of your brain simultaneously activated. It's not the same. It's just hearing somebody talk, because again I've infused it with without trying. I infuse it with a lot more. Wait, the normal words. And it's just because of training and technique. Anybody, you know, Tony Robbins would do the same thing without trying, So I recommend it at the same time. 

I just don't know how to describe it, because it's it's just not like anything else. Um, Scott speaks perfectly. Uh, that's a callback to I told you the story when I lost my voice for 3.5 years and I literally couldn't communicate. At least you know, I could make noise, but I couldn't make full sentences and stuff, and my affirmation at the time was that I would speak perfectly. Now I don't speak perfectly because perfect is the standard you can't really achieve. But nonetheless, it is true that my voice is on a a work of art. That's music now. I can't tell if he enhanced my voice or he just edited out anything that was weak sounding. But it does sound better than my normal voice. I don't know how he did that. So there might be some digital magic about that. Yeah, he might have auto tuned. Possibly if you listen to it. 

Is there somebody smart enough to know that my voice was auto tuned or even a little bit? I can't tell. But there does seem to be a little more character in my voice than what I would normally hear if I just played it back. Could be a moment, my imagination. So no. Yes, so it's on Spotify so you can look for it. The single the single is called It feels like It works. So look for Akira, the Don a k i r a the D O M. And that should pop up with your Google searches. And there's a whole album coming that I haven't heard yet, but impressive, right? 

Amy Klobuchar said she was dropping out of the running to be vice presidential pick because she thinks that by didn't should pick a woman of color. So throwing Elizabeth Warren under the bus at the same time. Now, because you are a seasoned political observer, what do you make of the story that Amy Klobuchar withdrew from consideration to be the vice presidential pick. 

What does it mean? That she withdrew and in withdrawing said that she supports a woman of color? Let me read between the lives. The choice is already made. Do you think Amy Klobuchar gives up? I don't think so. Maybe. Maybe. But there's nothing about her vibe or anything that I've seen about her. I have actually very positive, very positive overall opinion of Amy Klobuchar and have since the beginning, although on Day One I didn't think she had the charisma. So she's wanting in charisma, but that's a real I'm not sure you can fix charisma, but in terms of being a serious, capable, highest level politician, I always thought she was very good. And she's certainly smart enough to know that if the selection had already been made, the smartest thing she could do is act as though the selection had not already been made and then drop out by recommending a person of color. Biden presumably has already picked Kamala Harris, and everybody knows it. 

Then, when he does picker people who could say, Oh, that's exactly what Amy Klobuchar advised him to do. She wins. So in other words, she already knows she lost the race to be vice president. It's obvious to me she already knows that's over. The best thing she could salvage from this is to predict or advise or suggest the thing that's already happened cause you're not gonna be wrong if you suggesting something that's already happened. And I'm sure that Kamala Harris has been selected at this point now. Anything could change. She could be de selected. I don't think that would be the first time A vice presidential pick. You got altered at the last minute, but at the moment, it looks like looks like she is the bank. Um, and here's something that Harris did today, which reminded be of Trump. I've told you before that I think her advisers are now the world class type. When she was running just as a candidate in the primaries, she was a hot mass in terms off for messaging or body language or her unconfident laugh. It was just a mess, and all of that just suddenly changed, and even her strategy, I thought, was weak. But even your strategy is better. 

So I always tell you that Trump picks up free money. I used that as an analogy free money, meaning that Trump will do the thing that is all upside. No downside. And for some reason, nobody else thought to do it. It was just right. There was just obvious. It's just right here. Pick up the free money, anybody, anybody. So that's why Harris did. She is planning to introduce a bill that declares Juneteenth a national holiday. Now your first question should be. Why her? Well did nobody else thinking that if if President Trump has suggested this first to make June teeth the national holiday that I don't know if there's any resistance from Republicans, I haven't heard of any. I don't know if there would be a, but I would consider this under the condition. The Republicans would generally support this, and I don't know if that's the case ship. I haven't seen any opinions, but I would say that in this case, if that's true, and if, let's say Harris introduces it, let's say gets past, especially because the you know the the mood of the country maybe just sails through. I would say that would be an error on the president's part. It would be an error because he didn't do it. 

I mean, if this thing is going to get past, the president should have done that was just free money. But if it doesn't get passed, then I would know why he didn't do it right. So we'll wait to see if it gets passed. But the fact that she saw the free money and picked it up tells me that maybe Democrats sort of got out of the way and said, All right, we're gonna you know, we want to help the future ticket so the rest of us will just back up. Let Harris go forward, get the attention free money. So whoever is advising the Harris, you are nailing my friends. You are nailing it. Um, you know how much I've mocked her for her laugh or subconscious laugh or self conscious laugh? There's a video in which forget who is interviewing her, and the question they asked is, how could she be potentially How could she sport Biden or even be in consideration? Does a VP choice when she was so savage to him at the debates. 

Now that that's gonna be the big question, right? You know, everybody's gonna ask. Kamala Harris, better prosecution, background, and they're gonna ask her about throwing Biden under the bus as being a racist, Obviously, is not. You had That'll be the question. So, you know, she prepared for the question. And, you know, I believe she has now the highest level advisers who would have given her the right answer. And so the question is asked as she just starts laughing because it's so ridiculous. But she's laughing at her own answer. And she goes. It was a debate. And then she laughs. And then she says, a debate that laughs, Um, or she goes. It was scheduled debate we were debating because that's what you do when you debate. And then she laughed again. But here's what's different. The laugh didn't look like the old laugh. If she fixed through laugh, which I wasn't even sure it could be done, I thought it maybe could be done. But I think she fixed it because this was not a self conscious left. 

It was a confident laugh. She was so confident, rightly so, because her answer was a home run. The correct answer is it was a debate follow up, and it was a debate want. Want me to add some detail to the answer? It was a debate. Can you go deeper? Yes, it was a debate and laugh every time. You can't beat that, you could not beat that for a perfect way to handle that situation. Laugh and call it a debate. Never go deeper, period. End of story. I should not say period. In the story. I mock that It's too easy. It's in your brain and it just comes out. And when it comes out, I wish I hadn't done that. And so, watching her go from a self conscious, nervous looking laugh to a laugh that is so confident she won't even stop doing it in public like she just laughed and called. It's a debate. Your your silly It's a debate. Um, let me, uh, remind you because I know this is gonna happen when I say good things about any female politician. 

Somebody in the comments will always say there's men who it is all. You have a crush on her. You love her all you have such a you know you want to You want to be with her. You so I'm gonna block anybody who does that, that's just it doesn't add anything. All right. Um, Brian Stelter. You all know him? CNN. But one of the funniest tweets. Accidentally. He said, Dr. Fauci, diagnosing an American problem. Quote This is from Sochi. There's a combination of an anti science bias that people are for reasons that sometimes are, you know, inconceivable. Not understandable. They just don't believe science, and they don't believe authority. Well, is there anything that could have happened in the last? I don't know. Last 12 months or so, anything that would make the public less trusting of experts and authority and science. 

I'm racking my brain now. Anybody? Can anybody think of anything? An example of some time that the the experts were not exactly right. I'm coming up blank. I got nothing. Now recall my earlier story about carpi. Dump terms mean the reason it worked is that CNN literally can't tell the difference between parody and reality, cause they deal with so much fake news. The fake news is sort of the the hybrid of of parody and reality. Like it looks so similar. So Brian Stelter tweeted this maybe like it wasn't a joke. You know, like the rest of the country wouldn't laugh at this out loud. You can't me this. You can read this and not laugh at it. But I don't think Brian Stelter knew the half of the country would laugh out loud because his network has been feeding us a nonstop diet of fake news from experts. Every one of the experts who lied to us or got things wrong was featured on CNN. Every one of them, every one of them often. 

So I mean, this is parody in reality, emerging again. All right, Uh, here's the funniest comment in a tweet that I've seen in a while. And I have to warn you that I have a very, uh, lowbrow sense of humor. So this was some lowbrow humor that's actually got a clever That made me laugh. So I I'm doing this cartoon most. Have you seen it called Robots read news, and I put most of them behind a subscription wall on the locals platform. So if you want to see all of them especially the edgier ones that I don't put on Twitter, you could see them by being a subscriber. Locals L O. C. a l S. And you can see the link in my profile on Twitter by why the comic I did comic blocking the claims in the John Bolton book and the essence of the comic was that the robot was reading the news, and he reported that the book says that President Trump was taking a shit on the Resolute desk while asking questions about nuking the mood. 

Now it's funny because the Bolden book is so ridiculous and so filled with obvious lies at least obvious to me that there's nothing that you couldn't expect would be in it. I mean, so So uh so I said, uh, that he was shooting on the Resolute desk. We'll ask you about nuking the moon. And here's the comment I got from unstoppable Chuck. Test owes a Trump supporter, he says. That's it. I baked desk shitting into the cake when I voted for the guy I've been laughing for two days of that. I baked cake. No, I baked desk shooting into the cake when I voted for the guy. That's so perfect. Uh huh, because again, the reason it's funny is because if you are CNN, if you were seeing that you read this comment, you wouldn't know he was joking. You actually wouldn't know he was joking. If you're Brian Stelter, you look at this and say I think they would vote for him if you should on the Resolute desk, if you would. Ah, well, so we also in the news. Here's a tweet by President Trump. Let's see if you can see the foreshadowing this tweet now. 

I think the president does this a lot. He sort of he broadcasts. Or he he suggests where things were going before the decisions are made, you know, sort of testing them in advance and years. I think this is a test balloon. So Trump tweeted It was not ambassador later, Houser's Lighthizer. It was not Ambassador Lighthizer is fault yesterday in committee and that perhaps I didn't make myself clear that the US certainly does maintain a policy option under various conditions of a complete decoupling from China. Thank you. The president just tweeted that we're keeping open the option under various conditions of a complete decoupling from China. Do you see that news on any of the the any of the front pages? It's the biggest news of last 50 years. Here's what I think I think the president is has been so rightly embarrassed by China's unwillingness to be a good negotiating partner. 

And I think the president gave them every opportunity to be friends, which is exactly the right way to do it, right. I don't think the president should have gone hard at China. Should never have used the word decoupling. Never. The president never should have used the word decoupling in a in the sense of Maybe it's an option two years ago. If he had sent it two years ago, I would have been Whoa, that's crazy. You're negotiating with them. We don't know if it's gonna work out yet. Maybe the workout. Maybe you can get something done. It'll be hard. But maybe you could be done. Um, so you certainly wouldn't say decoupling two years ago. You go in with friend, friend, friend. You're my friend, President Xi, I respect you. And then you see what you can dio now, what was what was the Net if act of the president's completely smart, strategic original approach, which is, if you can get it?

If you can get something done as friends. Well, that's always gonna be the first choice, right? First choice always didn't work. Not only did it not work, but China doesn't even look like it was serious about any of it. Looks like they were just playing him. Now he has more options because now that he's, he's completely drained. Any any options of them being good players and responsible and good world citizens, that's all gone now. So now he can just put it on the table. Give us what we fucking what or go die, which is what this tweet sent. You have to read between the lines, but let me read it to you. And then I'll read between the lines. Eso He's saying that the US certainly does maintain a policy option under various conditions of a complete decoupling from China under various conditions. Do you know what the various condition is? Give us what we need or go fucking die. We're decoupling. That's that. It's no longer and negotiation people. Now it's an ultimatum. He's putting in the form of, you know, diplomatic talk. 

Well, if you do this, we'll do this. But it's now an ultimatum. He just put decoupling on the table. And China. If you're listening. China, I think you are listening. And one of the questions you might be having China because I'm pretty sure they have people who monitor most of the political talk in the United States. I don't know if they watch, maybe in particular, but let's say they do. China, You're probably wondering. Is that a bluff? Would the president actually decoupled from China? I mean, I know it's something that people say on Twitter, but the president just used that word. Is he bluffing? Well, let me say it to you as clearly as I possibly can in China. Nope, nope. 0% chance he's bluffing. Zero. There's no chance if you think he's bluffing about decoupling, You're wrong. You're fucking wrong. 

This is really now. Of course, it depends like you says on various conditions goes so China could always offer concessions and take decoupling off the table. They have an option, but it's pretty clear that they don't have any intention of doing that. Would you say it's pretty clear that they're just gonna push and take advantage anywhere they can? And you can't really do business with somebody who has that strategic you attitude. You can't do business with somebody who only wants to screw you. And it's looking for every opening to do it. That's just not somebody you can do business with. So you have to decouple if you're you're dealing with something like that. So, yeah, the president doesn't tweet this unless he means it. That is absolutely serious, China, that when you don't give us what we want and you won't, you won't. You know you won't. He's gonna decouple. It will be the greatest thing that ever happened to this country. Because China has been dragging us down for a long time. Took 40% of our manufacturing. Well, we're getting it back. We're gonna take it back. China, You've got problems there, Your problems. 

Now, Um, let's see the John Bolton bombshell is that according to John Bolton, who is a mind reader, I don't know if you knew this, but the but John Bolton, among his many qualities, can read the inner thoughts of the president. I can't do it. Maybe you can't. But John Bolton can. And he wrote a whole book about his mind reading of the president's inner intentions and Here's what he found. Um, there's he made a bombshell claim in his book that President Trump he wanted to do good things for the country but Onley for his own selfish purposes. Yeah, yeah, the president was trying to get a good trade deal with China just to get elected. I know, you know, this is almost as bad as that, like a store selling you a product, and they say it's good for you. They say you like the product and it will have advantages and solve your problems. That's what they say when they sell you things. But I have a suspicion the stores sell things for selfish purposes. It's really not about the customer. I hate to tell you that because your people you buy things from probably They say, Hey, this will be good for you. I think you'll be happy if you buy this. 

If you have this car, you're gonna enjoy it. I'm starting to think that's not why they do it. I feel like people don't sell things for your benefit. It's almost like there's some kind of selfish. The thing they're trying to do that do they make money somehow? By selling your stuff instead of just doing it for your benefit. I I'm confused by capitalism and politics, too, because according to John Bolton, there are people that we've elected completely unknowingly. You know, we thought we were electing good people, but I am shocked. There are people in the government who do things in public that are good for the public, but not for us. It's enough for us. It's for themselves. Bastards. Well, the MBA has a new plan for getting back Teoh games. Two interesting features of this one, of course, is that they won't have a crowd and it looks like they're looking to pipe in artificial crowd noise, maybe from a video game or something. So this is a real plan. They've got artificial crowd noises and it looks like they're just gonna, you know, sampling over top of the game. Now, I am not in favor of that, I would recommend, and I think they could probably do it quickly. A. 

An app were some kind of a bottle where the people working at home can actually cheer at home. And then if you're watching the game on TV and you go yea that your yea goes into your phone or whatever device you're using, It gets summed up with all the other people who are chanting. And then nobody. Here's your specific voice. It just gets summed up as crowd noise and presented in real time. Would there be a delay? It might be a lag that could be a problem, because you do need instant instant noise. I think you could do without the delay, probably. Yeah, or at least without much. So I would like to see riel crowd noise as from your living rooms summed up into crowd noise. That would actually be cool. But if you are a game and you knew that there was a guy with a button, it was just put pushing the cheering button every time there was a basket. How quickly will that bother you now? It might not bother you because you watch. If you've watched sitcoms forever, they have the laugh track and you this seems to work now. A Seinfeld famously did not have a laugh track. Did you know that Seinfeld famously did not have a laugh track? Nor do movies back when funny movies were being made? I don't know when the last funny movie was made. But backward movies were funny. Of course, movie doesn't have a laugh track, so you don't need one. But it's definitely true that it's been tested. And for some segment of the population for some kinds of content, it does seem to help you know, the scripted half hour comedies on TV. 

But those were dying out so and I think the laugh track might be part of why they were less popular. Um, talk about free money. Here's one of that Trump did. He was asked about Colin Kaepernick injury, and if he should get his job back now, you're all remember the story he called the the people who were kneeling and disrespecting the flag. In Trump's opinion, he thought, they're all bastards. Is that no sons of bitches? We're all sons of bitches, which, of course, was interpreted as racist, which it wasn't because I'm pretty sure sons of bitches coming every flavor. Um, but Trump said that he thinks Kaepernick should get a job if you know if he's still good enough. So you know he didn't have opinion on his skills, but he said, Yeah, get team should hire him. That was exactly the right answer, because President Trump is what kind of president? What kind of president? District president Trump Jobs is the jobs president. 

If you ask the jobs president, hey, should this black guy just was a black guy? Because that's the context of the story. Should this black guy get a job? What should the jobs president say? There's only one right answer. Yup. If he's qualified. Yup, unambiguously. Now that has nothing to do with his disagreement with kneeling. But to separate the question of Should Kaepernick get a job? You're the job's fucking president. If he had said the Kaepernick should not get a job because he disagrees with the the Kneeling, I don't know if I could have supported this president because you know what I want. I want people to have jobs, Kaepernick or not, I've been pro Kaepernick since the beginning. Much to your displeasure. I will reiterate that just cause I'm talking about it being pro Kaepernick means not necessarily agreeing with all of his political points or even the way he did it. I'm just saying that he was effective. He seems to be the real deal because you don't see him. I know you still on point on message. He seems genuinely seems passionate. It's a cause that has a real concern. I like him as a patriot. Honestly, I like him as a rebel. 

I like him as a patriot. I don't really follow Football. Don't care about is his athletic abilities. But I agree with the president. Absolutely. If he's qualified for the job, he should absolutely get a job. I very much so, and in fact, I think it would be good for the game. I would watch. I think I'd watch a Kaepernick game even if I don't watch football, because I'd kind of be curious. How would we go? So you don't have to like him personally. I don't know him personally. I'm just saying that as a ah protester, as a Patriots, I like it even if you disagree with some of the details. Um, let's see what else we got going on here. Make sure I didn't miss anything because it's all so terribly important. Uh, I think it had it all, all right, Nazis, air triangles or Nazi? That's all you need to know. Um, that's like out for new people are saying he's not a good quarterback. I don't know who knows, I'll talk to you tomorrow.
