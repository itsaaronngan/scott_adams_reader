I'm from. Do you know what I discovered the other day that you can use your Ah, digital assistant? Should you have one that will not use the name of the digital assistant? But it's a l e x A what? I don't want to wait by it up, but apparently you can just tell it to play the podcast by the name of this. This coffee was got Adams, and it just starts playing. I'll tell you, it is so much like the future. I'm just standing in my kitchen and somebody sent me a message saying that worked. I thought, Really does that work. So I said a l e x A play coffee was got Adams on Apple podcast and boom started playing the latest episode Kind of cool. Somebody says someone else was killed in chop. I haven't heard that, but we're gonna do something that will get this morning going just right. Yeah, it's coming up. I know some of you are prepared, and all you need is a couple of mugger glass. A tanker tells erstein that canteen, jug or flask A festival of any kind. Fill it with your favorite liquid. I like coffee and joining me now for the dopamine hit of the day. The thing that makes everything better It's called the simultaneous up. And it happens now go. Uh huh. So I keep telling you how weird it is to be me. Today's one of those days. You know, the thing that specifically makes it weird to be me is a I deal with the news, and then I wake up and then the news is about me And like, Oh, crap, the news is about me again. Uh, So I wake up this morning, Teoh Think, uh, Omar was telling me Hey, you're Dilbert is trending on Twitter. Now, the first thing you see when you wake up in the morning if the first thing you see is that Dilbert is trending where your own name is trending Yeah, it's not necessarily a good news. Eso you don't you don't automatically say Hey, this is terrific. I'm trending the first thing you think is Oh, shit. I'm either, uh, castled Koven or dead as I'd like to play. Whenever I see anybody else trending, I say, Are they cancelled that they have covered? Are they dead? Uh, so Dilber was trending this morning, and what happened is one of the traps that I had set had sprung. Now, uh, if you're not me, you don't think in terms of setting traps on Twitter, that's probably just my own, my own sick. My own sick hobby, I guess, is that sometimes I like to just put a tweet out there that just since they're often in the comments, not even a tweet just to comment, I'll put it out there and I'll just think, Well, this one could come back to me. So what I did WAAS. I had seen yesterday that Lena Dunham was trending and Lena Dunham was trending because in our world is 2020 she's Ah, I guess she's not a minority enough. She she's a little too white and a little too connected to rich people. It turns out, especially Hollywood connections, that she was trending for not deserving her success. How would you like to Twitter? How would you like to trend on Twitter and find out that the reason you're trending is that black people don't think you deserve your success? She just wakes up in the morning is like, 00 what's going on today. Check Twitter. Hey, I'm trending. I wonder why. Yeah, that's because nobody thinks I deserve my success. Bummer. So that's socks. So the thing they got be triggered yesterday and this will dovetailed into why I'm trending today is there was an African American gentleman who was based on his profile, assuming that he really is the person in his profile. And he tweeted about essentially about Lena Dunham Dunham's white privilege. And his point was that, uh, that black people don't have the white privilege. She did, because apparently she got her TV deal with nothing but a one page write up of a general concept. And then she had she had a TV deal now, So so black people were weighing in and saying things such as I studied film and for it, many scripts. I have much lots of experience, but I don't get to get my own TV show because I wrote something on the back of a napkin basically, and I was connected in Hollywood and my relatives were rich and, uh and so I just walk into a TV deal. I don't get to do that now. Is it fair to black people that they have to work hard to get jobs in Hollywood. But Lena Dunham, with all of her whiteness, gets to just walk right into a job. Doesn't have to try hard now. She had actually done some other things in in the business, so it wasn't like she never worked in the business. She had a little bit of arrest May, but still their point. Their point is quite clear, right? The point is very clear. Her white privilege made her more likely, more likely not necessarily guarantee, but more likely to be related to connected to network to somebody who could help her with her career. And that's just what happened. So that's racism, right? And here's what triggered May those of you in the comments can you? This would be a good time to, uh, to cover your ears of your kids. If any kids air listening kids, this would be a time to find something else to do. There may be some cursing, maybe a little bit of cursing that comes out in the next 0 60 seconds or so, and it goes like this, as the African American folks were criticizing Lena Dunham Dunham for succeeding because of her whiteness. Which was true, by the way. So that that statement is completely true. That as a white person, she was statistically far more likely to have a connection. It would help her guest something that other people couldn't get. Totally true also. Fuck you. Fuck you. Every one of you flock you because Lena Dunham's connection didn't help anyone of you did it. How about the people who are not connected to billionaires like me? Like most of you? How about fuck you? Every one of you who think that some other random wipers and shouldn't get that leg up because Lena Dunham had advantage. Lena Dunham had an advantage. That's not a white fucking advantage. Except statistically. Do you want to talk statistically? Because I don't think anybody wants to talk statistically. All right. You want to talk about an individual? An individual doesn't necessarily have a billionaire for a fucking father. An individual has a fucking problem. That is their own fucking problem. You got your fucking problems. Somebody else has a fucking problem to your problems. They're not fucking special. Your problems are not fucking special. Now it's hard to say that on Twitter. Does that love a lot of fucking in it and views on my character account just with just with fucking. So instead, I put a little trapped there that ended up with me getting, uh that ended up with me getting trending early still, but it in the trap was s. I put it in the comments just for context, just for context, that I had personally lost two jobs in corporate America. Most of you know this story for being a white male. They told me directly my boss told me directly to separate times two different companies. I can't promote you because you're whiten your mail in those direct words, the then that I threw in. And by the way, the trap is that I know people don't believe it. My experience has shown that people don't think it's true. If you're black, you just don't think that's ever happened. Honestly, you have no idea that reverse discrimination was pretty much universally true. I don't know how much is true today in corporate America, but certainly to some degree. And so here's what I threw in that I knew was gonna be the Red meat because it was a conversation of film people and writers who are my natural enemies. As you know, I always joke that when somebody comes in and says something rational to me, I just check their profile. Yeah, artist. It's the artists that never have the good argument, saying they're just really worked up and they never had any kind of analytical structure to anything. They say it's just random you, but unkindness. Usually eso I threw in the fact that the Dilbert TV show canceled because it was a white TV show and you PN had decided to become a an African American centric network the second season that I was not. Now, uh, they and this is the fun part. I knew that they would think that wasn't true. I knew that they would say, Scott, there's no such thing as discrimination against white people. They were just trying to let you down easily by telling you it was because your race. Now remember, I always kid that the artists and writers people in the TV business, people in the arts, they don't have even the slightest bit of analytical ability to the point where it's just funny to watch them trying to think, and this was what they came up with. They decided that they decided that in three separate times in my life that somebody thought the easy way to break me down to the easy way to let me down. And their and their belief is that I'm actually just incompetent and all those things, so that I was incompetent at the TV show. I was incompetent at my corporate jobs and that the way the bosses decide to let me down easily it was by being racist. What in what world do you less somebody down easily by telling them their their their ethnicity and their gender is the problem? It's the one fucking thing I can fax that's the opposite of letting me down easily. Do you know it would let me down easily? You know, Scott, you don't have the training for this drop. Or how about you? You've made some mistakes. Maybe you would be more suited in some other job. Maybe we could move you to a function where you know your skills and your interests are better matched. There are quite a few ways to let somebody don't easily one of the ways that on the list to tell them that their gender and their ethnicity is the problem. So that's why artists think when they hear my story now the other thing they think is that I'm lying. Who would lie about that? And so I was just very curiously. Can you develop your theory a little bit better about how I'm lying about it? For example, what would I have to gain? Did? Was it your theory? Was it your theory that my theory was that by saying I had lost three separate jobs because of my ethnicity and or gender, that I was gonna come out of hand on that? Does anybody think we live in a world in which saying that in public is in the any possible way good for May? No fucking way. That's good for May, and you can see it. The reason I'm trending is because I'm being attacked by people calling me a liar. Now, did I know that? Yeah, that's why I did it. I literally put the tweet there because I thought it would be funny to watch all these artists attack me for lying and making it up and I thought, Well, that will just draw attention to me. And the more attention it draws to May, the more I can say Let's have a full discussion because I think we should just consider all the elements. You've watched me long enough to know that I will go deep in listening to and taking seriously the claims of black Americans because they're all legitimate, you know, they're all based on legitimate stuff, right? So you know, I'm anti statute because I listen because I listened and I said, Well, you know what? Why does this bother you? Okay, that's pretty good reason. It's pretty good reason I can see why people might want the historical advantage. Well, above all, I can see the other side. But I think outside with the people who say, Why would you have offensive statues? I've talked about how to do reparations when most of you were just mad at me. Alright, so I've gone deep. I've talked to black lives matter tried to work out. I've offered help to Colin Kaepernick literally and publicly to try Teoh C. Hey, you got problems. How can I help is ready? I could do. So I think that I've done everything I can do to understand as deeply as much. You know, that the black situation in America in every sense. And if there's anything else that I need to know open to that too, listening to all of it and take it seriously, um, you've seen you see me put the work in to take it seriously, Have worked on the With Bill poll today we worked on the blight removal stuff, which is primarily for the benefit of the black community. I have some other projects that you don't know about that are entirely for the better than the black community. But it is also true the way people are widely discriminated against. Now, do I think you need to fix it? Let's I'm not even saying that. I'm not saying you need to fix anything. I'm not saying I'm gonna protest. I'm not saying that it wasn't even a greater good to have some discrimination in the eighties. They help to balance things out. I didn't I don't have an argument about it. I'm just saying that that's the context. Just look at the whole context. I read on CNN that apparently, there's some, uh, there's a little bit of, uh, push back against Indian Americans. And the pushback is that this is CNN's opinion piece today. So this isn't may. So don't attribute the next things to May. I'm just saying, When I read on CNN, it's CNN's opinion one person on CNN that the so called Brown people from India should be siding more with, uh with the black people who were protesting. But the problem is that the brown people are being considered the ethnicity, that air succeeding the brown people from India in particular. Their demographic group tends to do really well, and apparently they're not exactly siding with the people whose skin color matches them the most There. I think siding is too strong a word they're not strongly identifying with black lives matter. And that's the criticisms, like a your brown there, brownish. Shouldn't you be on the same side to which I say that is the most loser Risch opinion I've ever heard in my life? The most loser ish opinion in the world is that Indians from India in America should be siding with black lives matter because they have similar skin color. What? What? How could that not be just super racist? And that's just like an opinion piece on CNN that people just really done. That looks good, and I read it. I think this is literally the most racist thing I've seen ever. How about ever The most racist thing I've seen ever is that you should be in somebody's side because there's getting coming literally, literally. That's what they're saying, What's more racist than that? Here's what I would suggest that I said this before. And it's the sort of thing you can't say until you're so deep into the argument that you've given yourself a little space. So part of what I'm doing is being provocative intentionally in this space where most of you would get canceled for doing half of what I'm doing. Because if I can make my freedom of speech big enough that I can actually say useful things at the moment. The field for for free speech on this topic of black lives matter etcetera, is so small that the things you need to talk about to make it better you can't talk about, so this is like job. One job one is to expand the ability to have an actual conversation. Now there are things that you could say to any black person in person that they would not be offended in this Lazio you were played, your your intentions were going etcetera. But I find that there are things you just can't say in public that you can totally say to anybody individually. It's not even slightly offensive, which is where the dangerous. Because if you if you lose that difference and say, Well, I could say this easily by my co worker or somebody I know in person, it wouldn't be a problem at all. It's just when it goes large that, you know, the problem happens and here's Here's the thing that needs to be said and I've teased in a little bit, but I'm going to start pushing it harder. Why is that? The Indian Americans are far more successful than black Americans? Is it because of the legacy of slavery? I don't know, beats me. That's that's got to be in there somewhere, right? It's not like it has no effect, but the biggest difference among people is not skin color. It's strategy, and if we don't recognize that that's the big difference. Then I think we can't really fix anything because we're not dealing with a true enough picture of the world to know where the buttons are. You're dealing with artificial picture of the world, and here's what I mean. If you were to take the people who had the same strategy as the people who came from India and as a demographic group has been reported, their unusually successful compared to, say, other groups in the same situation, what strategy do they use? Do they have a different strategy now? I don't like to use the word work ethic because that that feels a little racist. Honestly, Do you hear it, too, When you say, Oh, there's a difference in work ethic to my brain that's just racist, I think, because that's not a strategy. As soon as you get into low, it's your nature to be a certain way. First of all, that doesn't apply to any individual because the individual differences are all over the place. But I just don't think that's where you should focus. It just feels like that's, Ah, there's nothing productive if you're starting to think like that But if you said to yourself, the Indian Americans came, had this simple strategy. Stay out of jail, stay off drugs, focus on schoolwork, and that's a few other things. But basically that's your strategy. You know, no drugs, no crime. Work hard in school. Now I think that you should only compare. The people have the same strategy to each other because if you compare strategy to strategy and then there's still a big difference, I would say, Oh, I think you found some racism like I think we've narrowed it down. Obviously, there is racism. I say Racism is universal. It's not limited to anybody that's universal, because your brains are your brains are pattern recognition machines. You can't really turn that off. They're just bad at it. Confirmation, bias and and, uh, and reality look the same to us. So I feel like where the conversation needs to G. O. Is to stop talking about statistical differences between people with something in common with her skin color and say, How about the difference between people who used a strategy we know to succeed versus the people used? The strategy we know never works. Why are we comparing strategies that don't work to strategies that do work and concluding that racism is the problem. What's up with that? So, um, I think the fact that we're focusing so much on race tells you that nobody wants a solution. Now when I say nobody, I don't mean people, because individuals, of course, one solutions. If you're just a citizen minding your own business, yeah, you want a solution? You want a solution? Um, people are saying strong families. I would say that that is untested. I think that there needs to be two models and we only have one. The one model that conservatives sort of approve of, if you will, is it's gonna be a nuclear family, a good, strong mother and father. And then everything goes well and I say, Yeah, that's great. If you're lucky enough to have to good parents, you know I love you and they can give you a good strategy in life. That's great. That is the best that nothing would be better than that, in my opinion. But it's also not realistic. Yeah, what's the point of having a strategy that you know can't work? Do you think you can take all the people in the world and say All right, we've solved it. You just need to find a great mate. What if there aren't any? How often do people get a great mate? Alright, how often does divorce happen? A lot. It's because we're not good at picking. Somebody was good for us. That's gonna last forever. Eso there needs to be some kind of other model where a kid can thrive despite having one parent. Now which of these three things can you not do? If you only have one parent, do you? Can you not study? Because you only have one parent you could study. You can pay attention. Do you have no choice but to get into crime? Because you only have one parent Now you still have a choice. You know you have a choice about doing drugs in high school because you only have one parent is that you don't have a choice. Got it? You got to do drugs. I only have one parent. No, it's still choice. So there's something that tells me that while while I completely accept, everything's easier If you had to loving qualified parents, this is not really this is that, Riel. It's just not gonna happen for everyone, right? So it's a fairytale to imagine that some kind of a solution, it's a good ideal, you know, if you want to push it as I like mawr of this, that makes sense, because it does seem to be a model that works. I would say, objectively speaking, All right. So just to follow up on the Dilbert TV shows story eso, then the the artists who are bad at analyzing things when all see and then on me when I say they went, all see, And then they found some information that was not the complete story, and they made some fake news, and that's how I got trending. And the fake news is that they discovered that when the show was canceled, the ratings were really, really love. So they say, Scott, you're lying. It's not because you PN decided to become a an African American focused network, which, by the way, that part nobody questions because that's in the record. You could find them saying it. It's obvious, Uh, they say no, even though it is true, the U. P N. Was becoming an African American focused network. At the time you were canceled, the reason you were canceled because you're ratings were low, and you've even said that. True, True, It's true. The ratings were low, and I did say that's why I was canceled. I also didn't tell the truth about any of this stuff for a long time. So why were they? Why were their ratings low? This is the part that the geniuses who were doing there there, little introduced new sleuthing don't get. The reason the ratings were low is that I lost my time slot from the season before, where ratings were good. Ratings were good enough to get renewed. Now, in the TV business, that's sort of binary. You're either good enough to get renewed or you're not. If you can get renewed than you can build an audience. Because even Seinfeld had a small audience in the first season. Did you know that the Seinfeld audience was actually very small in the first season, but because they got renewed, they found they found their feet and their their voice, and they became big. Dilber, too, um, had actually better, probably better than Seinfeld in terms of the first season. Um, because it was you did well in its time slot on UPM. Well enough to be renewed. Then it lost its time slot, and I think it was too. Uh, where do you member? A young teen blackstar named Mandy? She was on the network, and I may have this wrong, but I think she was the one who took that time slot anyway. Um, because her show did well and about that time, they also decided a Let's build something around this and make it the African American network. So losing the time slot to an African American product, which turned their focus to say, Let's do more of this because this seems to work and that they Dilbert no lo ger salvageable. So while the problem, the proximate problem was losing the time slot to another property, Uh, the the kill shot is that it no longer made sense to try to move it or promoted or make it work, because it wasn't going to be there next year, no matter what. All right, Um, and that's the part that the geniuses who got Dilbert trending today don't know. It's a little bit too complicated Alright, that's enough about me. Was way too much about me. Did you all see the video of the ST Louis gun toting homeowners? Did you? Do you see? It's the man and the wife there, standing in front of some high end home and looks like black lives matter And maybe aunt if I were starting to gather and before the crowd got big. You see the guy out there with this big s gun And what is what was it? What kind of gun was it? Gun experts can tell me. Onda wife's got a pistol and she's got her finger on the trigger, which, which is not exactly ideal gun safety situation, because she probably have. I'll bet she at the safety off, and she had her hand on the trigger and she was pointing it out. And apparently it was enough to make them decide that this wasn't the house they were gonna vandalize. Somebody says lawyers, I don't know if there were lawyers. Uh, they have poured poor trigger discipline is what somebody called it. Eso is they are 15. Somebody says that's that's what it looked like. I wanted to make sure Ah, she came and she gave without taking. So here's here was my take on that Number one. It worked. It worked. So the fact that anything works, what does that tell you about it? When something works, people do more of it. Right? When something works, people do more of it. Uh, somebody says is a our style. That's what I was wondering. If it's technically they are, or are there? Are there other things that look like it? I'm not enough of a gun guy, you know? Um, so So here's the thing. Do you think that this is going to stop before some whole motor guns down? Somebody from black lives matter or Antifa? Because I'm thinking it won't. I feel like there's gonna have to be some pretty serious gunfire before it's over. Now, just to be clear, I'm not promoting that. I'm not in favor of gunfire. It's a prediction. A separate nation that if you know, you always worry about the slippery slope. Well, I think the slippery slope will slip until the suburbs and the suburbs are gonna going to shut this down because the suburbs air well armed in the ways the cities or not, And there's no homeowner under that situation who won't take out a gun. So you should see black lives matter and anti faw meeting armed resistance. And it won't always be their own house. Sometimes it will be the neighbors. You know, if your neighbor is being threatened, you've got a gun. You might you might go out with your gun. So I think guns are going to be the solution to what we're seeing and it won't be. It looks like it's not gonna be government guns because the government has been neutered by excellent psychological warfare, the psychological warfare meaning that if a government God and kills a black person during any of this, then then the violence will increase instead of decrease. If a black if they say a black lives matter person or antifa gets killed by a homeowner in the in the in the act of some kind of vandalism, America is gonna be kind of happy about that. When I say America, I don't mean black lives matter. I mean that all the people who have homes that don't want them vandalized all the people who want the protesters to be reined in are going to be pretty happy the first time some of them get gunned down on somebody's lawn. Now it looks like there's nothing that would stop that from happening at this point. Now these the story of the ST Louis people were well armed. Um, they had good control. Uh, they had relatively good self control, cause I think I might have fired off at least a warning shot in that situation. I don't know. I think I would have put a couple of rounds into my own lawn just to tell them it was loaded. And I think that would have haste in their retreat. But that probably would have been illegal to Dio. So they're smart the way they handled it. I don't know. I could have had that much control. But here's the thing I'd like to add. Sooner or later, there's gonna be a homeowner who technically breaks the law by exacting some violence on some protesters. You know that's coming right? There will be a homeowner who kills or wounds a protester 100% chance that's coming. I would like to say the following should I ever be chosen for a jury in which a homeowner is being charged with overreacting, and it would be the overreacting that would make it illegal. So something that is not clearly self defense. But it's it's charged as something more like murder because the person wasn't threatening them but was on their lawn with the big crowd of people behind them shouting, We're gonna kill you! So something that's a little more grey area, you know, it's like it wasn't immediate harm. But on the other hand, it was an angry crowd that have killed other people and beating other people to death and their on your lawn. And you've got Children inside. And so you shot him. So you shot somebody dead on your lawn. For whatever reason you thought it was, you thought you didn't have a choice. Now let's say that it is technically completely illegal in that homeowner. Under normal circumstances should go to jail. This is what I'm declaring in public. If you put me on the jury, I'm not going to convict them, Period. I'm not going to convict any property owner for any violence against any protester. Regardless of the specifics, let me say that again. While this situation is ongoing that this is not a permanent thing, because if things calm down, you want you want the letter of the law to be followed. But at the moment, I'm just I'm just declaring therefore the benefit of the United States and as a patriot that I would not be involved in any jury in which I would even consider a guilty, guilty, uh, verdict for anybody who defended their property with violence during this situation. Now I don't recommend violence. Let me be as clear as I could be about that. Don't kill anybody. Don't hurt anybody unless it's self defense. So you just have no choice. Don't hurt anybody. I'm just saying that's the way it's gonna go. Somebody is gonna get hurt. Unfortunately, we hope it's the fewest number of people. But should it happen, and I assume it will, anybody who is on that jury is willing to convict a property owner for being a little overzealous and protecting their property. It's not gonna happen with me on the jury. Not gonna happen? No. And I don't care what the details are. I don't care if this person opened up and just started spraying the crowd innocent. That's it. I will not convict anybody for protecting their property. And by the way, it doesn't matter what ration, what nationality they are. I'm not saying I'm gonna little white people off that I don't care what your nationality is if you're protecting your property, if you put me on the jury, it's at least a hung hung jury. Actually, if you put me on the jury, it's gonna be whatever I wanted to pay, because you really shouldn't put a hypnotist on a jury. Do you know one of the questions that lawyers should ask? But never do. Are you trained him? Resist. If you're trained him to test, you shouldn't be on a jury because the rest of the jury is gonna just agree with you. You might as well just have one person on the jury. Now, I know you don't believe that, but trust me. Ah, I saw on Twitter today that Twitter has suspended the account of Sidney Powell, the attorney for General Michael Flynn. Does anybody know what that's about? Because when you first you first hear the suspension, you know it takes a while to find out what the reason Waas Ah, what was it? Somebody says, Come on, man. Their lawyers. Somebody says that the ST Louis people were lawyers. I don't know if that matters. So if your vehicle is in your driveway, that's not part of your home. No, I would. I would also say that if that's your property, I don't care where your property is, even if it's just your car. If if somebody in a car runs over a protester while other protesters are threatening the car, put me on that jury innocent. I don't know. I'm not going to listen to the details. I don't care. All right, I'm so let's find out why Sidney Paella got you know, which is weird. Because if in attorney is getting kicked off Twitter, don't you think the attorney would know what she was tweeting and what was risky and what the rules are? There's something weird about this story, and I can't wait to find out what it is. The Daily Beast decided to do a hit piece on Van Jones. Isn't that weird? Why would you do a hit piece on Van Jones? And here's the reason. Apparently he he helped with Jared Kushner. Hey, helped advise the executive order about that, the president signed about police and you think to yourself. Well, wait a minute. Isn't that a good thing? Van Jones, working with the administration, already has a track record of successfully working with them on prison reform. Something very popular on both the left and right, and it got passed. So isn't Van Jones a rare free thinking? Um, a rare nonpartisan? Well, I won't say nonpartisan. Everybody's partisan, say, a non extremist, most useful guy in the country. Like actually somebody. You could make something happen that matters. That helps people. That's Van Jones, right? So they do hippies. Here's why. Here's why they don't like Van Jones, or at least the Daily Beast attacks him. It's because he helped advise. Now we don't know how much of the final input was from Van Jones and how much wasn't. But when he went on CNN, he said that the deal was, you know, step in the right direction. Essentially, he did not say it's all good and we got everything that's worth getting. He said that it's a good, preliminary, solid step that people on both sides should like basically paraphrasing he did not say when he was talking about it publicly while he was saying it was good. He did now say that he was one of the people who advised on it. And so and so Daily Beast thinks that this is worth an attack piece to ruin his reputation in public. Or they're attempting to their failing but attempting to because he advised on something very important, vital to the country, tearing the country apart, one of the few people who is both credible and useful and just wants based on everything I've seen just once. Good results, right? One of the most helpful, self sacrificing people in the entire frickin the United States. And they go after him and they attack him. Talk about the enemy of the people. Now let's talk about the specific complaint. So he did not, uh, he did not fully disclose that the executive order he was saying has good parts. Wish it could be bore, but has some good parts. He did not disclose that he was one off Many people that Jared Kushner got advice from. Is that fair? Let me ask you this. Do you think everybody who advises the White House brags about it in public. Do you think everybody who advises the White House wants you to know that in public, For whatever the reasons are, I say it is completely fair. Did not disclose that. Do you know anybody who has advised the White House and did not disclose it? Yeah, you do. Probably quite a few of them. It is very routine to advise the White House and not disclose it. Why? Well, one, you're not a dick. How about that? Because disclosing. Hey, I advise the White House yesterday is just sort of a dick thing to Dio because you know what? You should let the White House present their case anyway. They want to if you want to help. If you want to help the White House, how about you keep your own fucking face out of it, right? You don't take credit for something the president's doing because you you gave advice for 10 minutes in a meeting. You don't do that? No. The White House and the administration, if if you consider the entire administration, they are continuously sampling for advice. I have been asked for advice. A lot of the blue check. Conservatives who have something to say have been asked for advice on different, different topics at different times. Do they all talk about it? No, No, you don't do that. That's not how it works. You don't advise somebody in the White House and then go talk about it on TV. It doesn't work that way. Now, if if the story was that you were invited to the White House, the Oval Office, they took a picture then of course, you say you know that you were there and you talked to the president. And when they say, What did you say to the president? What do you say? None of your business. None of your business. That's that's how it's supposed to work. So here is Van Jones not trying to you claim credit for anything, not talking at a school about You know who you may have advised exactly? Like you'd want into exactly the way you'd wish he would act. And they write a fucking hit piece on him. The only guy who is trying to fuck and do something useful. Now it made it very clear that the at least the daily beast doesn't want a solution. I mean, you don't have to read too hard between the lines to realize that they didn't. They wanted the fight more than they wanted any kind of movement forward. That's pretty obvious, all right. There's a story about a company named Perform Path Lake Mary's Florida Company, and they've introduced an ultraviolet light. I guess you can just replace your light fixtures or your bulbs. I don't know if it's a bulb with life. Picture might be both, but you can basically put in lighting with ultraviolet. And they're aiming at team and venues, you know, places where you have team sports and Spectators and they're looking Teoh basically use this UV light to disinfect the entire area all the time. Does it work? Well, hard to know is expensive, but I'm just telling you that that's out there and that, and it could be that ultraviolet light. I'm just gonna give you the most positive potential. Imagine it works, and I would think they need a little more science to know for sure. They do know that the U. V has an effect on the viruses, so that part is known what they don't know is, if you put it in a lot of ceiling lights and a lot of places, do you get a different result, But probably I mean, come Sense tells you it's worth trying. Let's say it works. Could it be that we will develop technology that makes it safer against all viruses forever? Uh, yeah. Za specific type of UV light, not generic UV light. Thank you. Um, this could be one of the biggest things in human development because think about all the damn viruses from the regular cold to, you know, every other kind of flu virus. If if the UV light can kill those things without hurting people and it can basically flush it end of indoor spaces. If you can get rid of viruses indoors with just light bulbs, just make sure you have a couple of those lights in each room. If that does it, this is one of the greatest. I mean, this would be a bigas. When humanity learned to wash its hands with soap, this would be that big. I mean, that's pretty big. Who knows it for the work? We'll see. Um, anyway, the here's as there's a scariest thought of the day we've talked about the Yanni and Laurel Audio's. So there's their audio illusions in which you can imagine you hear something one way, and then you can just imagine it another way. And here is the other way. So given that audio illusions are established as a thing we know we can make people hear different things, even sending the same sound. And it has to do with how they're primed now. Imagine a bad, a bad character, a bad, let's, say, a country that wants to start a revolution or a riot in another country. And they want they want to do it with misinformation. One of the technologies that apparently is available is to send a message that half the people will listen to and will say, I don't hear anything wrong with that. And the other half will say, My God, are you listening to the same thing I am? What I hear is that they're they're not Nazis who want to take over the world or whatever it ISS. Whatever is the worst thing you could imagine. So if somebody created an intentional audio illusion, let's say it had somebody somebody you thought was a good politician, but the audio illusion made it sound like they were using the N word. Now I think of this because there's a video of Joe Biden using the n word that I heard it, and I said, Okay, that didn't happen. So as soon as I heard it, I was like, Okay, that's a picture of Joe Biden. His lips are moving, and I clearly here that n word coming out of his mouth. But as soon as you hear it, you go. Now that didn't happen. That's some kind of a fake. It turns out that the nature of the fakery is it was just at a context, and he was quoting someone else while condemning them. So if you know he's quoting someone else and condemning them, that changes the context now. Should he have used the word in its natural form while condemning them? Will remember, it was pretty far back in time when it wasn't as obvious that that would be the worst thing in the world. Should he have done it. I know it's a small problem. He was obviously, his intentions were right and the times were different, so I wouldn't make a big deal out of it. But it reminded me that how easy it would be to have a piece of misinformation in which people could. Clearly half of the people would say, No, it's not on the video. Trump is not saying those words, and then the other would half would say, Uh, it's right there. We listen to it, open your ears. You must be lying to us because we hear those bad words clearly. So there is a potential for really bad mischief, the kind that would actually destroy a country if you use that technology. Um, what are the odds that a pandemic would make masks mandatory at the same time that the protests really require masks to be successful? Is that the weirdest coincidence in the world, or is it a coincidence? Now the conspiracy theorists would say the everything from the Corona virus through the statue stuff is all planned by some cob. All of Marx is somewhere in this guy now. I don't think that's the case. I think it's an actual coincidence. I think it is an actual, just legitimate coincidence, but a really bad one, because if people couldn't wear masks How large with the protests may now, as many people said, the looters weren't married wearing masks. Yeah, a lot of those people weren't wearing masks, Um, to which I say they only could do what they were doing because there were so many people and there were only so many people because so many of them could wear masks if you just. If you took the masks away from the non looters, there would be no looters because it wouldn't be many people there. And then the police would have numbers and they would just stop the looters. It's the number of people that gives them their power and the only way they can get the number of people, even if 1/3 of them are not wearing masks. The only way you could get that big number is with masks. And I would say that you can't solve this problem as long as we're wearing masks. You can't solve it as long as it's mandatory to wear mess. But here's what I would suggest, and I don't know you could test this and see if it makes things worse or better. This easily could make things worse. but just test it out. Suppose the police could very calmly just detain a member of Antifa. Not even necessarily somebody was breaking the law. Let's say there's an anti mask law, which is three anti mess. Law, of course, would be overridden by the need to wear masks for the pandemic. So you have two conflicting laws, but the pandemic one is sort of a particular one for a particular purpose. Could the police stop somebody and say, just for the purposes of identification? We have an anti mask law, but since I don't want you to be in danger, we'll stand six feet away. I'd like you to drop your mask. It will just take a picture. That's all you could put your mask back on and you're free to go. What would happen now? Of course, they might resist, right? The obvious thing is that they would resist. But it does seem to may that if the rumor started catching on that the police were we're asking people to pull their mass down to take a picture, and if they refused, they would be arrested because there's let's say, there's an anti mask laws which not everybody has. So it seems to me that you could at least have a shot at taking a lot of the energy out of the protest by allowing the police to take a photo of somebody with their mass down just temporarily in the safest possible way so that you're not putting them at risk for the Corona virus. I just put that out there. There might be something to work with their but also could just be a reason for a fight. Do you have cause problems? Depends, Uh, by didn't say shoot the looters in the legs and then remove their masks. Uh, he had going inside a bag with mask has got a scary. So I used to be a bank teller. It was my first adult job. And let me tell you, if I were a bank teller and all of my customers were wearing masks, I would not be a happy camper because I got I got robbed twice when I was a I tell her, All right, um, somebody says they work in a bank. Barr said. All 14 terrorist task forces have been activated, meaning that they're going after the organizer's as terrorists. Somebody says. It's a brilliant idea, but it will reveal that the politicians are in the tank with protesters. So one of the things I'm hearing from smart people is this that the reason there doesn't seem to be as much focus on solutions is that the organizer's don't want them. They don't want solutions. I think that's closer to true than not true. While it is definitely true that there are plenty of protesters who want a solution to police violence, it is certainly not true that that's what's driving the protests. It just isn't What's driving the protests is the organizer's, the TV, the social media and it's a small group of people who are manipulating the larger group to do what they dio. But the small group doesn't want a solution they need. They need infinite conflict to take this to, you know, to his broader conclusion, which is power, of course. And I think the as I said earlier, the only the only way that's going to stop Ah, somebody says in the in the comments. A new Rasmussen poll says nearly 40% of believe voters believe Biden has dimension. 40% of voters think Biden has dementia. Now, you don't have to look at the details to know that that's divided by largely along party lines. So, you know, obviously they're more Republicans who think Biden is has dementia than there are Democrats. How much of that is just political? And how much of that is confirmation bias? How much of that is cognitive distance? Well, I think you're gonna see the numbers somewhere in the 20% range of Democrats who think that Biden has dementia. Yeah, there it is. In the comments, somebody saying that 20% of Democrats think Biden should be checked for dementia. I think technically it's probably more about he should be checked for it, as opposed to he hasn't because we're not doctors, right? Is more about Maybe we should check this out. I think that's always the underlying assumption. Um, now 20% of Democrats thing Biden has dementia, and 100% of the people watching this periscope probably think it. What's up with the other 80% of Democrats? This is an interesting question. So they're 80% of Democrats who can look at Biden and according to them, according to that was 80% of Democrats. I don't see a problem. Do you believe that? What would explain the gigantic difference? And in people seeing a problem, obviously, and people who say no well, well, some of them are, of course, lying When you assume, don't you think some of them relying because they just hate Trump more than they care about? Having the president has dimension? That's got to be some of them, right? I don't know if it's Most of them are just a few of them, but some of us lying. But I like to suggest that this is the ideal set up for cognitive dissonance. Now, if you've ever had trouble understanding where cognitive dissonance is, and you just wanted, like a really clean example, this is it. This is the cleanest example of us of a set up that is guaranteed to create cognitive distance. Let me say that again, the set up that you're seeing with Biden getting this far, But yet clearly having signs of dementia is the perfect set up to generate cognitive dissonance. In fact, you could run an experiment with just if you could find some way to do an experiment with a sample of people and give them this set up. You would see cognitive dissonance half of the time, at least at least half, maybe 100%. I mean, it's a really strong effect. And here's the set up. People wanted to beat Trump, and it's there. Number number one Most important thing, All right, The most important thing. The Democrats. They've gone through this entire primary process in which the Democrats were looking for the finest, most effective leader that they could pick out of all Democrats. They came up with Biden's and now, in order to get that thing they want most, they have to back biting as their champion. What would happen to your brain if you found yourself in a situation in which you had to back a guy who obviously had dementia because to do otherwise violates everything you think about yourself, which is I'm pretty good at picking, picking politicians and voting, and I'm a member of the Democratic group and were the reasonable ones. So obviously we're gonna pick somebody who understand science and and very importantly, doesn't lie because a big problem we have is that Trump guy keeps lying and saying things that are wrong and some facts around, we can't have that. So we need a person who's famous for telling the truth. Oh, that's a problem, Because what are all these clips about Biden lying and lying and lying about his own resume? I mean, just crazy things, like he's on tape saying he had three degrees when he has one, and he said, Oh, I forgot. I forgot. I only have one college degree, about three or majors. I think it was. Was it degrees or majors? I forget, but anyway, it was some wildlife eso You're a Democrat. You get caught in this trap. The only way you can get rid of Trump is too to accept. Somehow the Biden is a functional person. It's the perfect center for cognitive dissonance. So my guess is based on my experience that most of those people who say no I don't see it are telling the truth are telling the truth that most of the people I don't know if it's 51% or 90%. But my my experience says that by far most of the people actually are perceiving a world in which Biden is perfectly fine that's wild, isn't it's wild to know that that the perceptions can be modified in real time. I mean, you and they that you could stand right next to it. They could be standing right next to you and watching one of those compilation clips of Biden just mentally falling apart. And you could say, All right, well, you see it now, right? Right. You're watching the clip. You're standing right next to me. We were watching this clip. Now you see it, don't you? Right. And do you know what they would say? There's a um no, no. I see somebody like everybody else. They sometimes fumble the word. He's a certain age people of a certain age. Maybe we'll reach for a word a little bit longer means nothing. And they will just freak you out and you'll be like, Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? We're looking at the same video at the same time. He is not all there. And the other person just want to see it, and you won't know if they're lying. That's the weird thing. You just won't know if they're lying and you'll say, I don't know if you're telling me the truth is that just what you want me to think is true because you see it, don't you? Don't you see it now? This is very different then when the the anti Trumpers say to any Trump supporter. But you see, he's he's not passing the fact checking, right? Don't you see that we say the same thing? Yeah, yeah, we see it. It's hyperbole, you know, he's directionally true. Doesn't care too much about the details. Hasn't affected anything yet. We still prefer him over, You know the alternative. So when you talk when you talked to Trump supporters, they seem to be completely aware of what they voted for and what they got, which is not cognitive dissonance, you know, But you don't see you don't see too many Democrats, if any, say, you know you're Biden is mentally incompetent, but I'd like a mentally incompetent president because I think it's a step up. That's a little harder to say, huh? All right, that's all I got for you to today, and let's go forth and have a terrific day and I will talk to you tomorrow
