but Popo the pump from Hey, everybody, come on, It it's gonna be one of the best coffees Was got Adams off all time. That's right. Representative Maggie's will be joining me if our technology works the way I hope. But first, get in here, given here we get all kinds of stuff to talk about. The world is spinning around and things were getting out of control. But between all of you and me and my upcoming guest, Matt Gates, we're gonna work this all out. We're gonna figure it all out before we do that, though. What do we do first? Yeah, that's right. It's called the Simultaneous Sip. And all you need is a couple of mugger glass, a tanker, Chelsea's Diana canteen jugar flask, A vessel of any kind. Fill it with your favorite lipid. I like coffee and join me now for the unparalleled pleasure, the dope immediate of the day, The thing that makes everything better, including the economy, including the Corona virus, including racial divide. It's all better. A little bit, just a little bit. It happens that with simultaneous TEPCO uh oh, that's definitely better. All right, let me, uh, check my technology here. All right. In a moment, we'll have representative Matt Gates join us. I have a little update for you. What? We're waiting for him to get on, and the technology is always, you know, a little hard to navigate, so we'll do our best year. Um, I got a, uh, an update on, uh, carpet dunked, um, and Raheem Kassam to people who had been, um, temporarily limited in their twitter use for content in the case of carpet dunked. Um, uh, there was a d. C. M. A request. There's an official way that somebody could request copyrighted material to be taken down. But the question is, even though it's copyrighted, it's used in the concept of parody. So it's a little bit of a gray area. And then it was Raheem Kasab who showed showed a video that included the time of death of somebody. And if a family member requests video being taken down because of time of death, Uh, then when that happens, they they will take it down. Now, in both of those cases there, I guess Twitter is working with both Rahim and Carpi. Duncan toe, see if they can get them back up and also within the rules. Now the question that I ask is, Why would you ban the person instead of the content? If you know there's just one piece of content that's questionable, why not just block the content and say, Hey, let's talk about this content. Either have to remove it or we're gonna have to work something out. And it turns out that Twitter's actually looking into that as well. So I think what makes us feel like an attack on conservatives or even individuals is that they block the whole account or they'll you know they'll limit the account in some way because of one piece of content which feels wrong, right? Like just the way that feels like Wait a minute if the content is wrong. 

But everything else has been fine up till now, when I just blocked the content and that will work out what's wrong. And apparently Twitter's looking into exactly that. So there are some things upcoming that will be exciting in the Twitter world, but that that continues. All right, let me see if Met has there we air What's the ad representative Gates? And if our technology works which looks like it didn't He just disappeared. So, um, Matt, you just disappeared when I tried to select you. So, um, try that again as soon as I see your indicator. Come on. All all idea. All right, we've got, uh, there is I'll bet you this will work just great this time. Because, as you know, technology always works just the way you want it to looking better. 00 Didn't work again. This is the problem we had the first time we tried to do it. I don't know if it's a WiFi problem or some other kind of technical incompatibility. Let's try one more time. Um, I've got my phone set up, so if they text me to tell me what the problem is all No, we're back. I imagine they're trying different devices and stuff, uh, to get this working. All right. Whoa. We're, uh, waiting for that. I want Teoh talk about an argument I've been seeing online that I think about a lot. And I don't think we're doing a good job of handling unless I had Matt again. Watch this work, representative Mac, it's I can hear you, I think. Are you there. You're Yes. Finally, score. Let's do this. I feel like we've now got audio privilege. We should probably have to disclaim. Yes, I I feel a little bit guilty about this. Um, first of all, you have started a new podcast called Hot Takes, which is terrific. Uh, how's that going? Well, I really enjoy it. I think that the news of the day really opens the door into the questions that we have to answer in the Congress of whether their questions about the nature of speech in this country, or really, what we see going on with an effort to, I think, dismantle America by trying to make us love her less. And I am just a non unapologetically pro American. 

I think this is the greatest country ever. But I think the tactics that we see to try to deconstruct our history to try toe, take away a sense of national pride are far more dangerous than just, you know, the destruction of a statute. I think they're really trying to get to the destruction of the system. Well, let's talk about that. So I have not fully bought into the conspiracy that there's a master plan. I believe that there are probably some people who think of it in the long term. But what percentage of the protesters do you think have a master plan versus they like the fund? They're angry, you know, it'll burn itself out. How do you break that down? The master Marxist planners versus the people were just having fun, looting and protesting and and free speech. I think that it is driven by the money. I mean, I think that that a substantial amount of the money that has existed for the infrastructure of these organizations is fueled by a neo Marxist desire to to shame America into a crouch of both domestically and on the global stage. And I think that there is a general grievance movement that is out there. You know, they'll show up in occupy Wall Street if you want him to. They'll show up for a black lives matter, protests if you want to. They're just sort of in for the grievance. And I think that makes up a lot of the volume of the humans. But But the money is, you know, the the financial desire to see this. This neo Marxist revolution combined with sort of the corporate America white guilt payoffs. So who exactly is the money behind this? Because it's hard to see anybody who could gain by more socialism because that basically kills. I mean that that might as well throw your money in a big pile and set it on fire. Who? Who can make who can make money by paying the United States to destroy itself? Well, I mean, I think that there are foreign entities that that benefit from this I mean you. 

We have seen some reports that there have been Venezuelans, Cubans that have tried to infiltrate some of the leadership of these organizations to try to fuel anti Americanism and and so division we know beyond that, they're they're foreign influences in the black lives matter branding, particularly from Russia and China. They used these racial divisions to try to stoke mawr anger and tension in our country. But but I think that that for the most part, the call is coming from inside the house. I mean, I think that within our country there is there is a grievance culture and this is the current manifestation. How compatible do you think black lives matter. Leadership is with whatever the intifada. If you can even call it that any kind of leadership or at least leading voices, Do you think black lives matter and anti far are even on the same page with each other? I doubt that that is a sustainable coalition or a resilient coalition. Right now, they're sort of, you know, united around a common enemy, and sadly, that enemy is our sense of national pride and national identity. What those groups have in common is that they believe that America being that shining example, the America being best version of herself, is ah is damaging to their sense of grievance. How do you How do you deal with the fact that, um, you know, America as a brand we like Teoh, you know, if you love your country, like to put it in the best possible light. 

But it is nonetheless true that America has a violent and brutal racist past that got us where we are now. How do you keep your brand and your love of your country while still being honest about how we got here? I think we could be honest about the fact that all human history is full of identity based violence full of brutality, full of, you know, sort of human competition and the negative impulses that that can create. All of that said, in a world of relativism, I'll take the United States and our development and our promotion of values and our sense of inclusion over just about any other human society in all of human history, because it creates the unifying principle of prosperity and opportunity for people. You know, my, my take on all this and I want to see what you think about it is that when we focus on the problems, we have taken a sort of a loser mindset, which is Oh, I'm I'm disadvantaged. You've got privilege, I don't etcetera. And while all of that can be true, sometimes not. But it certainly could be true. Um, how does that change the fact that all of us have an individual strategy and if everybody followed the same strategy, we'd all get pretty good results. Meaning pay attention in school, don't have a baby when you're 14 Don't go on drugs, you know, work hard, have have some additions to your talent stack, etcetera. So They're fairly basic things to do that everybody can succeed. 

Which works actually better if you're black, frankly, because if you knew that corporate America is literally begging for more people of color because they need it, I mean, there's a lot of pressure on. So everybody has a three lane highway in America. If they follow the same strategy, why are we focusing on the problems and are disadvantages, which is just divisive? Instead of figuring out how to get better mentoring, better education, better strategy? Because they know that he had a good strategy. They probably all do. Well, I think you're right. I agree that when we unify around the common opportunity that exists in this country for for any who are willing to work hard, play by the rules way, draw more people to the cause. But I don't think that every every sort of sexualized a group wants that unity. I think that there that there are leaders in some groups of people, and I'm not even talking about racial identity. I mean, I think you see this geographically. I think you see it politically where people think that division sort of creates an opportunity within their movement for their own advancement and for their own leadership. But but I think that when you talk about focusing on on the positive, we also have to do that with Americanism. And so often like, for example, in the immigration debate were told. Oh, well, the way Republicans talk about this is xenophobic. It's racist, my views that if we instead focus on that positive, that the wonder that exceptionalism that comes with being an American, something so worth preserving and being proud of that that that also can be, ah, more unifying call. And unfortunately, I think way. Take the bait as conservatives, not even as conservatives, justice people who believe in America. We take the bait and grant the premise that somehow there is something flawed with our founding and with our history. And I think if we if we acknowledge that all humans have complications, challenges in multi dimensions in our history, but that ours is absolutely the best, that hopefully that can that can prevail. 

But we surrendered the ground in schools, you know, probably, you know, 15 20 years ago. Scott and I think that we're starting to see the manifestation off the, uh, just that, like the egalitarianism that we embraced in education in this this cultural relativism. You know, when you look at base problems and you're trying to figure all right, what? Where's the big lever? What's the most right impactful thing we could do? It just all comes down to school, doesn't it? I mean, I know some people are going to say having parents, but I'm not sure you can fix the parent thing right away, but that the school thing seems like something that the government could fix if it focused on it. It is the great equalizer. My dad was superintendent of schools in the community where I grew up. He was never a teacher or principal. He was a business person that was elected to the position because he thought that if we could improve the operations of our schools, that the outcomes would be better. And ultimately they were. But the, you know, the I think education associations, three unions. I think some of the, you know, social justice warriors that attacked curriculum in particular made a lot of progress while we had our eye off the ball. You know, a lot of Republicans over the last 15 20 years have been focused on How do we teach your kid coating while the left has been worried about how we sand away the founding values of America? And I think they made progress in that regard. You know, there's something that you and President Trump and I have in common in terms of mindset. Unless you disagree with this, which is even if I'm looking at an optimistic future or at let's say, a rosy picture of America, I do that strategically. In other words, I know that when I put my positive thoughts into the universe, I just get a better result even if they're unrealistic. And and I feel like that's just intentional strategy. 

But if you look at it not as a strategy, it just looks like you're loopy and crazy and you don't care about problems and you don't care about other people. But can you? Could you talk to that? Is it is the strategy, or is it just the way you see the world? I think, particularly with President Trump me, he believes that he can will positivity into existence. You can't believe that in business and that on the campaign trail. And, yeah, he does it in government. It it is infectious. It is an infectious style of leadership to try to draw people to their highest achievements. And President Trump is unique in that he can at times create a competitive environment in which people literally have to, you know, create more and more optimism or on more progress, more and more success just to stay at the table. And I like that. I think that it also breeds a meritocracy around the president. And it's why, frankly, some people don't last long, you know, if they're if they're unwilling to get get with that type of, ah, of leadership style, they find themselves out of government. As for me, I think we still have a lot to be positive about, and I think that we have to. We have to frame our vision and our values in a way that draw people to our costs. Look, we might not want to admit it, but the dominant political movement in America today is this. Black lives matter, movement and you know the the way I think to combat the downstream effects of that is toe unapologetically embrace Americanism and then, as you've done on social media, push back against the tactics that just try to silence people. 

I mean this whole. This whole characterization of white privilege is a racist characterization. It's racist because it is telling someone because of the scholar color of your skin, you have a diminished contribution to make to our country into our conversation. And I just don't think that anybody should be told based on their background or their skin color that that they have a diminished contribution to make. Now, how many politicians are willing to say that? Because they're afraid of being called racist or privilege for saying it. But I think that when you tell people the truth, that is ultimately the most productive and most optimistic thing you can do. Yeah, here's the way I put it. You come across a kid in a well trapped at the bottom of the well is the first question you ask, How did you get there? Because it depends how you got there. If you fell in the well one way, I'm not gonna help you, But if you fell in the well the other way, I'll help you. How does that make sense? Kids at the bottom of the well, you don't care if he's black. You don't care if he's white kids at the bottom of the fucking well, Can you help him out? Right? So and I think that we get lost in the past. It's like, Well, this kid got in the bottom the well, because his parents were, Ah, you know, they were drug addicted and love a blob. But this other one had a history, a legacy of racism and slavery that is rippled into the future, which is a real thing. You know, I don't think anybody would doubt that there's a ripple effect. But once you're at the bottom of the well and your baby, it's just not your fault and and and thinking about how you got there is SOA unproductive when you should just say, baby at the bottom of the well, what can we do about that? 

All right, what would you do about the protests? The especially that chop the Seattle place? Do you think the president should b'more involved either verbally or with assets? How would you handle it? Look, the bottom line is, we can't let these things get set up because once they are, they do get fortified. I mean, there are a lot of guns in that place. And let's just have some honest talk about this, Scott. We could march the National Guard in there and take the chop the Chazz over in a matter of moments. But there would be loss of life, and I don't know that this country is ready to handle that. And so I'm I'm grateful that in Washington, D. C. Is they've tried to set up an autonomous zone. The president, the chief of staff have ensured that that will not happen. The weak leadership in Seattle, though, can be contagious. I think as Americans look at what is going on, it affects our sense of security and safety. And it also tells the permanent criminal element that they have more latitude now. They have more latitude in my town and you in your town because of what is going on in Seattle now, ultimately, I really do view it. It's more like akin to the occupy Wall Street thing. I think this ultimately fizzles out, but if I were the mayor of Seattle, there would be no way that anybody would be stopping the delivery of care and ambulatory services and police to people who are in need. I think it is. 

It is infectiously bad leadership. And I'm grateful that the president isn't allowing this to be set up anywhere else, particularly in our nation's capital. But you would agree this is a really this is a tough one because, as you said, just one death especially caught on camera as we know that that magnifies it. It would just take one death by a government gun and we're right back to square one. So, you know, I don't know that anybody is smart enough to know how long to wait, how much force to put on it. But I But I saw this interesting development, which is apparently the businesses will be able to sue the city. And I always say, if the government can't work it out, the insurance companies well, because because ultimately, ultimately, every everything gets priced for risk, and it just won't be affordable to be, you know, to be bad government anymore. Just get well. But think about that. Think about the impact on the marketplace, right if my business interruption insurance risk profile is different because I'm in a liberal city that is going to defund and dismantle the police and keep them from going in certain areas, then what will happen is it will be easier to get necessary. Business interruption insurance in places where you have strong leadership with law will be enforced. So what that will do is create mawr blight, more flight of capital out of these places, and and frankly, while that will inure to the benefit of of states like Florida, it's not good for the country to to have such a depressed sense of confidence in areas that have embraced these valleys. You know, I'm starting to wonder if there are some urban areas that just can't be fixed. In other words, you know, maybe you just have to find a field somewhere and build a new city where you get things right from the start. Do you think the urban areas do you think Baltimore even can be fixed? I don't know if there's any amount of money you could put in there, because the basic problem is that the leaders are too easily bought. If we can be honest. If you're a mayor, it's just too easy to be bought off by the wrong people. It's so interesting. You say that because right now, as you and I are talking, Joe Biden's team is out there vetting all of these urban mayors for potential selection for vice presidency. And my guess is that it's gonna be very difficult for any of them to pass that. Because you're right. 

A lot of it is is pay for play in these urban cities. And it's one of the reasons why, despite very high taxes, despite a Thanh of money flowing in from the state and federal government, quality of life isn't really improving for the people, right? And so that begs the question. Will is the trump strategy of, like, the opportunity zone the right antidote? And frankly, I've got some doubts about that. Like, I don't know if when you when you pit one community against another, if that's really the role of government, like right. If you're a wah wah and you're deciding where to go build 50 stores, is it really right for the federal government? Say well, if you build them in community A and said. A community be we're designing that outcome to try to direct the flow of your capital. So I think I think time will tell whether not the Democrats strategy of, you know, building the largesse of government, abandoning your people and then just sort of being along for the ride. For the for the neo Marxist Revolution is the right play or whether this this kind of trump playoff opportunity zones and seeing if you can socially engineer economic success is the right way. I mean, I think ultimately, the way every American society flourishes is when the uniquely American institutions flourish. When we have strong families, when we have strong churches, when we have empowered parents with school choice, you know. And by the way, in Florida, we just signed the largest expansion of school choice in our state's history. So will be a laboratory for that concept. 

I think I think that's the institutional strength is probably better than the government economic engineering or just the government theft. You know, I I'm gonna take the third path. You know, Aziz, you laid it out there kind of these to general approaches. I think the third path is Let's be more organized about testing these different approaches because, you know, I don't think anybody smart enough to know what works. That's the problem, right? If we were smart enough, we just be doing that. That works. Let's just do that thing. We're all smart. But if you don't know, you got to test it. And then you got to make sure that your test is really telling you what you think it is. So it's gonna be designed, right? But it seems to me that you we should just be focused a gun. All right, here's the places trying this thing here is this year's places trying the other thing. We'll check back in six months or a year. See how it looks. Do more of that. Oh, and that that is the promise of our great federal system. Right? But but the problem is that you you drain that promise when you have corrupt people that now in some of these urban areas air trying to externalize their conflict, right, like the mayor of Seattle has a problem in their own in our own community. And so she blames Donald Trump for being a racist Azaz the reason why, and it's that that is the most unproductive I think, way to resolve this rather than the testing strategy laid out. You know, if if I could fix the world, it would look like this, you'd have teams of, let's say, consultant type people who could be brought in UN request not forced in to a city to say, Look, we're just gonna have this external team run your city for a year, fix things up, get rid of the corruption because they're sort of un corruptible because they were well paid and they come from somewhere else and at the end of the year will have you have an election trying to put somebody in. But the big problem is that the money is corrupting at the local level, and if you have people who can be corrupted, they will be. 

I don't know that there's anything that can be done about that, so unless you bring in almost like untouchables and yeah, I talked about it as like government in the box, bringing the government in a box with the intention that is like a chia pet. Just add water and your government will grow. But I think part of part of that type of engagement requires fair, free, open, honest discussion and debate. And, you know, I was listening to your interests. Got about these, these voices that have been taken off line and the different dynamics and equities that are being balanced and I have to share. I was quite taken when I saw a tweet from a Republican leader, Nikki Haley, recently that when she observed what was going on online, she was troubled by it. But any more regulation would just put lawyers and bureaucrats in charge, and that that really is a an equally bad ill. And so she presumed that we just have to sort of sit back and accept the fact that free speech is eroded in our country. And that's loser. Talk to me. I don't believe like, I don't believe that we just kind of surrender to the cancel culture. And just as we're hearing and you know, the social justice based down that it's not enough to not be a racist, you have to be anti racist. There's only two groups of people. There's Racists, and there's anti Racists. So I want to apply that to the cancel culture. I guess there's either the people who cancel or the people who UN cancel and I want to. I want to do some UN canceling. I think that even if people have said things that are controversial or un Cunth in an unguarded moment or earn an impassioned moment, we ought to have the opportunity to invite the best of the contributions. People can make toe our discourse. And we should not be so frail as a nation that we cannot hear things that offend us and then respond to it with more productive speech. That's that's my riff on where we are on the canceled. So if there were some or government less a muscle or are regulation, let's call it on the social media platforms. What form would that take? 

What would that look like in your preferred world? I believe that so digital media platforms availing themselves to the benefits section 2 30 of the Communications Decency Act should require should be required to be transparent about the extent to which their platform truly is content neutral. And I think that you know there is the common carrier approach, but they're simply a a demand for transparency that can be built into the exo skeleton of the Communications Decency Act to say Okay, well, you know, if you don't want these liabilities for being an aggregator or a curator or ah constant developer than then you have to open the kimono and demonstrate that it is in fact, neutral. And I think on appeal process, uh, could be required by the government that that would shed a lot of light onto the decision making that goes into what is promoted, what is suppressed, what is banned, what is allowed. But a lot of these that we saw from the undercover Project Veritas video on Facebook That is not so much company, regular rules that are changing things. But they're individuals making judgment calls. And there lots of them at a change that I think I think that if that process becomes more transparent, it will be easier to identify the sort of corrosive and rotten places within it. Right now, we don't even get a peek, we're told. These are private companies will have to be way the government. We, the people really just have to accept whatever our Silicon Valley free speech home monitors tell us, and there is no mechanism by which to like vindicate our own voice. And I think that that you get to that element of the people of the people who are running it. Also, I think there have to be consequences when folks like Project Veritas and they're fantastic. By the way, when they go find these things out, I think that there should be investigations. There should be reviews. 

The problem. Scott, just to be candid with you is that big tech has bought off Congress, and it's not that hard to do because Congress can't really act if a small group of people are opposed to it. So if you go and deploy of three lobbyists for every U. S. Senator if big tech goes and starts hiring the Children and spouses of members of Congress for jobs which by the way they do all the time, then it really retards our ability to demand the transparency that that would that would fully realize our First Amendment rights. Yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing some kind of rule that says you can't vote if your kid is involved in one of those companies. Wouldn't like that um and tell me what? Given that police reform got stalled because literally nobody in Congress wants this once a solution so much as they want the issue. Apparently, I'm accepting you for that. What would you do to break the logjam and let me just throw this idea of top? I think there needs to be a national education about police and race. Just so we're all on the same page about what the date is and what the options are. What's the plus and minus reach of these? Yes. On chokeholds knowing chokeholds and talk it through. Would it help to educate the public so that the public and push Congress Or is there a better way to get something done right now in Congress? It is all virtue, signalling with very little virtue on the police. On the police reform front, I would support various repositories for the type of training, data and information that you described so that we are all singing out at the same him, Bill. 

Now it sort of feels like people are striking up different chords in different notes at different times. But on the specifics of the policy, there are areas of agreement like I am not going to defend no knock warrants to me like if the government is entering your home and they're not telling you why that is a problem. And where I'm from, we have to castle doctrine. Somebody comes in your home with you intend to do you harm. You know, you have the ability toe respond with lethal force. So I do think that there are ways to improve policing, like like changing the no knock warrant system. But right now, Democrats don't want a bill. They they want the ability to blame Republicans. And I think that that that too often is just sort of where we go to Washington, D. C. The solution here. Scott is going to come, I think. Still at the local level, I think you see, police is developing different technologies strategies on policing. They work to different degrees. I think best practices will be copied, you know, around the country. And hopefully that's away toe continue to improve the profession. But I'm certainly not going to be a part of demonizing demoralizing de funding the profession. And the craziest thing about this bill the Democrats have it seems toe wanna put law enforcement at an equal level of force with the people that would terrorize our communities, like since when that we believe that we ought to go into a fight equally armed and manned with, like the gangs and cartels. I mean, I want other people enforcing the law, protecting our citizenry to have an overwhelming advantage enforced from those who would do us harm. You know, when we talk about eliminating the police, I have surprisingly, been open to the idea, but only if you start from scratch and develop community with that expectation. In other words, you might have less privacy, more video surveillance, more Net Mawr, neighborhood watch or something. You couldn't get rid of the police entirely, but all that you could take it down 50%. Well, my my few is informed by the vulnerable. 

You know, one of the one of the major moments in my life was when I was nine years old and I was in the car with my mom, who was in a wheelchair, and she was mugged and, like we had to call the police. And you know when when you're there with a mother in a wheelchair. You start. You start to realize how vulnerable some of some of us are, and we need strong law enforcement for the protection of the vulnerable. And so I I'm heavily informed by that. And I'm so grateful for police that that respond in the circumstances where they're needed. All right, So I don't want to take any more of your time because I know you've got a country to run here, Uh, that these needs your help. I got to say, I've been watching a lot of people on TV on the news, and certainly on the the Republican side, you are by far the best communicator the Republicans have. There's nobody even close at this point. Um, and I think that that speaks well for your for your future. So thanks for coming on. Uh, Congressman Mac Gates and make make sure everybody takes a look at your podcast. Hot takes. If you just google it, you'll find out where that is. Anything else you want to add, Matt? Just that I'm grateful to be on, and hopefully next time I will take fewer than five attempts to connect for a little coffee with Scott Adams. but much appreciated, my friend. All right, thanks so much. Have a great day. All right, that was fun. Now, a couple things I've got my list. Um, there's an argument that I've been hearing that conservatives make that I think is weak. Now, you know me. I'm not taking the left or the right side on things. I like to go with the argument so it doesn't matter whose argument it is. If his week I want you to know about it. 

The argument goes like this. So people will say, Hey, the black community in this country is complaining about, you know, economic equality. But say the conservatives, can you explain that theme or recent black Africans who have immigrated more recently are doing far better economically. And so say the conservatives. It can't be because you're black, because the Africans air doing fine. But the people who have been here for a while or not now, of course, one argument to that would be there's there's a ripple of racism or disadvantage that's built in the system from slavery to today. That would be one response, but I think there's a far more obvious response. Far more obvious, which is that if you're in another country, whether it's Africa or anywhere else, it's kind of hard to get to the United States. How do you How do you immigrate to the United States is not easy. So first of all, you're going to be a capable person if you can even get to the United States. Secondly, you probably have to demonstrate they have some education. Um, you know that you can support yourself. I don't know exactly what the rules are, but my guess is that there's a self selection process right exactly seeing it in the comments. The people who are immigrating are self selecting because they're motivated and ambitious, and they feel that the American system is suited for their ambition. If you told me, doesn't matter what country they come from, doesn't matter what their ethnicity is. If you tell me I'm going to compare a bunch of people who made it to an entirely new country, learned a new language, and we're so motivated they thought they would go across the world and defended to the system and work hard and succeed. 

That group's always going to do well. There shouldn't be any surprise. The people who self select for motivation, proper risk management, you know, going to the right place where the energy is best. All of that is predictive of success. So has nothing to do with ethnicity. It's a self selected group were motivated. Every self selected, motivated group of any group is going to do pretty well compared to everybody else. So I would say that argument of Hey, what about the people who came recently from Africa doing well? It doesn't say what you think it says s I would I would drop that argument frankly, all right, I'm seeing a lot of folks say, as I said earlier in the interview, or the conversation with back AIDS, that a lot of people are saying that President Trump is being too weak in this current Protesters situation, and I don't think that's demonstrably true. So the thinking goes that, um, if he acts a week, Republicans won't respond to that. They'll feel like he's not doing his job. But I do think people understand that the federal government, uh, does and should wait for the local government to invite them in, and when your federal government is Trump and you have been accused of being a Yeah, I tyrant racist. And that's your one of your worst accusations. If you've been accused of being a tyrant, racist President, do you want to send your military end unrequested Under requested being the important part to almost certainly kill somebody and almost certainly they're going to be a person of color just because of the numbers of people in the area, at least one. And then the whole problem starts up again. So I think the people who say he should be acting strong. Uh, I'm not sure he has the options that you think, And I think that it might be a far stronger play than you think to simply let the energy dissipate because dictators don't do that racist. Don't do that. 

You know, just just letting the temperature come down because, you know, once it comes down, you've got a new set of alternatives. Now, in the case of the autonomous, So I think that's a special case because, uh, they, you know, they do set up a little bit of defense, etcetera. And here's how I would handle that. Here's how I would do it If I were the mayor and I wanted to clean out that that area, I might just invite the public to do it for me. Now, I haven't thought this through, but just just bear with me for a moment as men. The advantage that the protesters have over police is numbers, right? The police have guns and trading and all that. But the protesters, mostly they just have numbers. But they don't have numbers compared to the actual population that lives there. And the actual population that lives there isn't really engaged. They're just sort of hanging back. But what if they all came to the street? Said we got your message, We heard what she said, and we're good and they're gonna be 10,000 of us standing behind this line of police, and we're just gonna march with them and help them clean up stuff as they clear the people out. So imagine a model where there's a bunch of police deeply outnumbered by the protesters who are the occupied zone and behind the police are 10,000 citizens who are not armed, and they're just there to clean up, literally there to clean up. And so the police come in and just in every foot that they gained slowly and Aziz nonviolently as possible directly behind them, the citizens come in and reclaim the territory, clean it as they go. 

And it's just a show of force, basically. But the show of force is just the number of bodies. It's not that they're armed or that their violent and you'd want them to be completely, you know, a nun involved with the violence. Um, I got this idea from some small town in Washington state where I saw a video of one of the conservative ex military people saying, You better not try it in our town. And his explanation of it was that however many protesters there were there were gonna be more people from the town and they're armed and numbers matter, right? If you had a lot of people from the town relative to the number of protesters, well, the protesters were gonna bet, you know, behave themselves they're not going to set up in the town of so I don't know if that's a good idea or bad idea, but I thought I'd put it out there. Um I tweeted this morning it seems to be pretty popular that if anybody who does these eight things will be successful. And anybody who doesn't just won't be. Which of these A things are unavailable to people of color? All right, I'll just read him and keep in your mind. Can anybody do these things? Or is it reserved for white privilege type people number one to focus on a useful education? I put the word useful in there. 

You know what that means, right? Uneducated. That has some commercial values who focus on a useful education, which means you get good grades and that Do you have a chance to go to college? Stay on illegal trouble. Obvious. Stay away from drugs. Obvious. Now that that doesn't mean you experience. You didn't experiment or you got drunk on the weekends. I'm talking about becoming a drug addict. Don't do that. Don't become a parent to sued. Build a talent stack, you know, assemble skills that work well together to make you special and valuable, um, be useful to others. This is the most under unappreciated one you have to create, create a set of skills and, uh, I guess Ah, personality. If you will the other people say, Hey, that could be helpful to bay. I would like that person. As a friend, I would like to be with that person. I would like to hire that person I would like to buy from that person. So become a useful person. You know what it looks like. Just be useful as opposed to being selfish all the time. Favor systems over goals. That's longer description. But a system is something you do every day to get you closer to a variety of goals, such as a system for your fitness assistant for your diet, a system for networking, a system for promotion, etcetera. So develop you systems. That would be it would be different for everybody. But you have to have systems and then learn basic risk management. 

That's sort of a general statement, but a lot of people do things that just are bad risk management. I'll give the obvious example. Let's say you wanted to invest in stocks, but you had never been taught risk management. So you say I've got $10,000 I've saved up over the years. I'll put it in this one stock Well, that shows that you don't know risk management, because that's just a bad idea. You never put all your money in one stock. You spread it around and hope that the winters cancel out the losers. So that's just one example. But there are a 1,000,000 examples at life which you could look at and say Okay, if nobody told you the odds, who wouldn't be obvious? Like the like, the example of diversification. As soon as you hear it, you say, Oh, yeah, kind of makes sense. But if you'd never heard the word diversification, it just wouldn't be obvious. Just wouldn't be obvious that you should do it. And in all of life is like that. The risks need a little bit of guidance to know what makes sense and what doesn't. So my contention is this that, of course, they're weird exceptions. If somebody has a health problem, etcetera, that those are obvious if you get you if somebody shoots you. Yeah, he made I have a successful life, obviously. But if you do these eight things, which of them are unavailable to anybody in this country? There's nothing of this list is unavailable. 

Everything of this list is available to everybody, and I don't know anybody who can do these a things which are not terribly hard because some of them are. Just don't do something, don't do drugs, don't commit a crime. It's not hard to not new things. It's hard to do things sometimes. But stop that hard to not do things except for a peer pressure at center. I guess there's a new kind of racism lately, which is a weird kind. When I say new, I don't mean it never existed before, but it's it's more provident. It goes like this. How often does a white person in 2020 June of 2020 where a lot has changed about? We're thinking about the world, even from last year. How many white people who are hiring or looking to work with somebody would be afraid of working with a black person, not because they were racist themselves. You know, even though arguably everybody's a little bit racist cause we're all biased. But let's just say if somebody who has no history and no conscious thoughts of racism, which is about as close as you can get, and that person has an option of hiring one of two people. Let's say they're both qualified. Both qualified. Does the white person in June 2020 say to themselves that they're equally risky? I don't think so. Because would you hire somebody that you think hates you? Right? It's one thing to know. Hire somebody because you are a racist, very illegal, immoral. 

It's, you know, it's one of the great evils, right? So if you're the racist, that's pretty bad. But what if you say to yourself, You know, I watch television? And if I were a black person in America, I'd have an attitude Right now I'd feel if I had been consuming the same media that everybody else is feeling, and I were black. How would I feel about white Americans in June of 2020? Maybe a little bit of an attitude, maybe a little contempt, maybe a little thought that there's a little privilege there. Maybe you think that you're a little bit more racist than you thought even a year ago. So is it reasonable or is it racist? I guess it would be racist by definition, so I answered my own question. But don't you think that there is a saying in the comments that there's a little bit of agreement there. It's actually a new form of racism in which people will say I'm not a racist, But I'm pretty sure that if I have a black person that they will think I am. Why would they think that? Because the black community is listen. Reinforcing through black lives matter, especially, is reinforcing that Basically, all white people are racist, even if they don't know it. Think about that. The message is that all white people are racist, even if they're not aware of it. So would you hire somebody who believed you were racist? I would not. Yeah, let me let me demonstrate my free speech here for a moment if I had two candidates equally qualified. And I have no racial animus or feelings or negativity of my own, at least on a conscious level. 

But I'm positive that the person I'm talking Teoh let's let's say, let's be specific. Let's say it's a black candidate positive that this person follows the news and is politically active. What are the odds that that black person has a good feeling about me as just a generic white person? Don't you believe that they think I'm a racist because I think that's the message that black lives matter wants all black people to accept that all way. People are racist all the time, but not always consciously. I don't think I would hire somebody that I suspected. Thought I was a racist, my rob. Now, by definition, that would be racist and also illegal, Right? Wouldn't that be illegal? I wouldn't. I wouldn't I be sued for thinking that somebody would discriminate against me. That's different, right? So I'm not saying that this form of of racism didn't always exist, but it went from something I don't think I ever would have thought about even once. Let me put it this way. Two years ago, I wouldn't have thought of that. It wouldn't have even been a a glancing thought across my mind that if I hired a black candidate, that black candidate would certainly not like me and would feel a little bit racist. I didn't think that two years ago that's something that black lives matter taught me. So while they're training, let's say training and educating their own, uh, public. 

Let's say the black public to distrust all way people for being racist, even if the white people don't know they're being racist under those conditions. Have the black lives matter not taught white people not to hire black people? Because that's what I'm hearing. I'm hearing it would be bad for me Dire Somebody who had a bad feeling about me, and they're being trained to have a bad feeling about me. So obviously there's no you can't do that legally, so I don't recommend it. It's not a recommendation. It's a statement and an observation. Somebody said something happened Toe Hawk Newsome, but I don't I'm not up on that. So I can't comment on that. Um uh, and apparently Tic tac has been reverse engineered. So you know the APP? Tic tac. Uh, I don't know how valid this story is, but there was a story of an engineer who reverse engineers APS for a living. So he's reversed, engineered lots of different maps. But when he reverse engineered tic tac, allegedly he found a hornets nest of obvious spy intention and things that were designed it just to make you not know what it does and that his recommendation to after reverse engineering it is that you should not have that app anywhere near you because it's just by God you and collecting your personal information so that some of you reverse engineered at that. He's quick to point out that he has also reverse engineer. 

I guess the Twitter app, some other APS and said that they don't have that. So if you're saying, oh, they're all the same Twitter, tick tock, it's all the same. Apparently not. Apparently not. If you reverse engineer the Twitter app, you just don't find anything scary. It's just a nap. If you reverse engineer the tic tac app. According to this one story, I'd like a little more confirmation. When you hear one story from one source in today's day and age, you gotta put that little skeptical check mark next to it. So put the skeptical check mark next to it. But there's one report that the tic tac app is just filled with spy spy code, all right, and obviously the Chinese government can control anything that Tic TAC does. So you've got that, um, so the D. O. D. Has said this for a long time about tic tac. Well, why is it still legal? What? Why? Why can a child walk into your house with a tic tac app? By the way, you don't have any idea how dangerous that happiness you might find out soon. But I don't think you've thought it through to know just how dangerous that IHS It's not. It's not a small thing. If you were going to size it, let me put a size on it. If you're gonna size the risk of the ticktock app compared to other dangers in your world was size. Would you put on it? I would put it the same size as, uh, radical Islamic terrorism. Bigger? No. Bigger Because terrorism probably doesn't have an option. There's no real risk that terrorism will destroy the whole country of America. That's that's not really a possibility. 

Because of the nature of it. You probably couldn't happen. But could at AP destroy civilization? Actually, yes, Actually, yes. So if you have an app just a piece of software that has the potential to destroy civilization, you would you put it on the same level as, let's say, North Korea having nuclear ARBs that sort of a level. So in terms of the level of risk. It's the highest military level of risk. Should it be weaponized, it can be. It can be. And in fact, it's not even hard. That's the problem. The problem is, it's the hard. If it were hard, that would be a different argument. But it's not hard to weaponize it, all right. Um, why is the government so slow to act with regard to tech? Well, I think it's several things. One is, you know, lobbyists and money and money influence. That's part of it may be the biggest part part of is that they don't understand how many. Let me ask you this. 

So I just described to you the following chain of events. China can control technology because it's a Chinese company. Their algorithm can control what you see. Therefore, they could make anything popular such as, for example, oh, how about a prank where people will buy tickets to or or sign up for the Trump rally but not go? Was that going to be viral by itself? Ask yourself, Would that have been viral just because some kid made a viral video about Hey, we should prank. We should prank the Trump campaign, a tic tac and app for Children. You think that a political point, a political thing was going to be the big viral thing on Tic Tac, an app for 12 year olds? I don't think so, but it could. They it's possible. But you don't know now if it becomes popular and Tic tac, What happens? It goes to stop, Chap. So take Hack is excused to the young people. Snapchat does, too. But Snapchat also has young and older people. At least you know not old, old but older. So anything that's popular on Tic Tac will eventually become viral on Snapchat. Once it's on step chat, it's everywhere. It's Instagram, It's Facebook, It's Twitter. So can the Chinese government send any message they want all the way through our Social Media Network? Yeah, easily. It's not even hard. In fact, we probably just watched it happen. You just don't know. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm saying take back and set a tic tac. Those of you were accusing me of being a boob. Er you are so right. Uh, that I embrace it. I embrace my full barbarism flaws, and I do not apologize for them. Uh, somebody says there was no link on Snapchat to Trump's rally. Really? You can say with some confidence that nowhere on Snapchat there was any mention of the ticktock Tic tac break. Really? That's that's pretty knowledgeable of you that you know, all of the things on Snapchat. Uh, but in any case, whether whether that wouldn't move two steps yet or not, that's the obvious path that other things could take. All right, I think that was all I wanted to talk about today. Yes, it is. And I will talk to you later.
