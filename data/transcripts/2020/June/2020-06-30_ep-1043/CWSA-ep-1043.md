I'm bum bum bum bum. Well, I think we should try it again, this time differently and better. Because if you tried to join me in the 1st 2 failed attempts at the simultaneous sip coffee with Scott Adams, you know it didn't go Well. I'll explain that. But some of you may be prepared for the simultaneous seven. Maybe you already had it. Maybe you'd like to do another one, but it happens right now. And all you need is the camera. Margaret Glass, A tanker challenges started the canteen. Joker flask. A vessel of any kind? Yes, I'm doing this for all of the O. C. D. People who are watching this. I include myself in that category. In this context, sometimes you just need your routines. And I know you wouldn't feel the same if I didn't come back and finish this. And so I invite you to enjoy the dopamine. The end of the day, The thing that makes everything better. The second simultaneous sip, maybe the first for you. Go. So here's a little lesson in anger management. Um, I aborted by first a couple attempts there. Well, actually, the second attempt because my my anger overwhelmed. Now what I was angry at, you have no idea because it wouldn't be obvious from what you were watching. So I wasn't angry that my technology wasn't working because I had a guest on. I was angry at myself because I have this problem with, uh, calendars. And when I say I have a problem with calendars, I mean, it's one of the biggest problems in my life, literally. And I would love to know if there's anybody else in the world whose has this problem it in general, I have a problem with time. Uh, if you give me your phone number out loud and you say blah, blah, blah, blah ba I can hear the numbers, but I don't have a sense of what Warner they came in if you say it quickly. So I've always had sort of that audio. Uh, let's say issue with time. I hear things, but out of order. Likewise, when I read, somebody noticed once that I don't read sentences necessarily from left to right, which is true. I kind of look at them, left to right, right to left middle, that word because things arrive and then I just reorganize them into why should have been the order. They they they should have been. So if that sounds like dyslexia, that's what I call us sometimes. But it applies to, um, it applies to all things calendars. I guess This weird thing where I could look at a calendar for my day, it'll be just a square box for the day. And it'll be nothing written in there. No appointments whatsoever. They'll say, Ah, I've got nothing on my calendar And then somebody will say, like, today. Hey, what about this appointment? Where are you or where you on the so call? It will think. I just looked at the calendar. There's nothing on my calendar that will pick up the calendar. Look at it and there it is. It will just just be there. What it so clearly wasn't there the last time I looked, and sometimes it might be because my calendars and sinking Sometimes I'm crazy. Sometimes I have a false memory of looking, I don't know. Maybe it's some variety things, but it is so consistent that it is like a glitch in The Matrix. You know, it's like my simulation doesn't working. Um one of my being jobs Every time I make a comeback and Dilbert comic, I have to put the date of it. So I have to figure out what date is gonna run in the future, Then write down the correct date. How often do you think I can look at what my comic is? Do it means just there's a list assesses. Do what the state and then just write the date of the comic pretty easy, right? Here's the date. You just write it down. How often do you think I do that wrong? After 30 years of practicing every day, about 80% of time roll about 80% of the time. I can't write down the date or look at it and look at the right day of the week and translated my end to what I need. So I'd be really interested. If anybody has a calendar specific problem that doesn't seem to be affecting any other part of your life because, you know, I could do pretty much any other complicated task effortlessly just effortlessly and somebody saying excessive. We've now. I wouldn't say the same thing, except it's always been the case. So It's not something that happened when I discovered marijuana in college. It was a continuous lifetime thing, anyway, has nothing to do with anything. Let's like about the news. Um, so the story about Trump and whether or not he was briefed on the Russian bounties story that they were putting a bounty on Afghans killing American soldiers. And here's the thing. This story was so important that is the national headline. And everybody agrees by God, if this is true, it's a gigantic thing, right? Everybody agrees that there's nobody who say no, no, no, that wouldn't be a big deal. Is there anybody says that? Nobody. But yet it's such a big deal that the briefers never thought to mention it to the president. Apparently, the claim is that it's in. It's in the briefings, but so buried in so buddy briefings that it took a while to even find out it existed. So what exactly is going on that we think this is a really big story. But the people who briefed the president didn't think to mention it allowed, knowing that he doesn't read the you know, the detailed, uh, reports, he would depend on them to tell him what's important and that never came up. That never came up, right? There's something wrong now. Could it be that the reason it didn't rise to the level of importance with the people who actually understand how the world works, the people briefing the president? Could it be that this is fairly routine? Do you know what I mean? How unordinary isn't for some country to be paying the bad guys in some other group to kill the people that you want influence in this group? How unordinary is that? Because it might be just so route routine and so ever present. It's entirely possible that the people briefing the president, it just didn't seem like it was a top 10 concerned because it doesn't matter why somebody's trying to kill you. If you're in Afghanistan, then you're in the military. You're kind of looking for people to try to kill you all the time anyway. Like do they need a reason? Does anybody does anybody think Who thinks that you have to be bribed if you're the Afghan, you know, fighter who thinks you have to be bribed to kill Americans? Well, uh, I wasn't thinking of killing Americans. But now that you've given me all these excellent Russian rubles or whatever they are, now I'm thinking of a suddenly baby. So, uh, CNN has tried to Carl Bernstein that again to, uh, to say, crazy stuff. You mind reading stuff like Trump was seeking Putin's approval, Trump is always seeking Putin's approval. Why is trouble always seeking Putin's approval? To which I say, uh, is that like, reading his mind? We know what Trump does that I mean the things we could observe. We know, for example, that he has been soft on Putin in public. Other times he's been, you know, quite hard in terms of sanctions and whatnot. So we see what he does but to then translate that into he's seeking Putin's approval. And I think, How dumb are CNN viewers that they think they need to turn on the TV to see Carl Bernstein, the worse than Watergate guy comment on his mind reading skills that have been wrong every time so far? It's just weird that this is even on television, and then it works like apparently it works well enough that they bring it back. You must be popular to their audience. But that, of course, the thing I always tease them about is the only Bring Carl Bernstein on. If the whole point of it is to get him to say whatever you're talking about is worse than Watergate. It's like the whole game because it's not like he's used the natural person that you would be invited God for any other reason. If he didn't have the ability to say it's worse than Watergate, if you took that away from him, he would never be on TV. So it's obvious that that's the, you know, the driving thing, Karl, you know, do some articles on this and were given about three interviews about the third time. Heinous hit us with the worst of the Watergate. That's gonna be the highlight clip. All right, um, so I told you and my aborted periscope that I've decided to endorse Joe Biden, but only to protect protect myself from racist Democrats. We'll talk about racist Democrats in a moment a little bit more, but, um, you may recognize this maneuver from 2016. Uh, what? I said that I was going to endorse Hillary Clinton, but only for my safety I was completely serious, meaning that it actually kept me safe. I was able to say, Hey, I endorsed Hillary. What do you coming after me for? It's got a confusing. So I am going to literally endorse Joe Biden. I don't expect this will have any influence on anybody's votes. What does anybody care what anybody else endorses anyway? What? Why is that even a thing? And you know I don't vote. Yeah, I'm not a member of any political party. Don't blend to May. And I don't plan to vote because it biases me. But if it makes me safer, you know, during this violent revolution that we seem to be see seeing here, I endorsed Joe Biden. So let me let me just run this by you. Angry mob comes to my house, and I say, where you here bothered me. I endorsed Joe Biden, and they say, Did you? I don't think you did. You're always saying good things about Trump. I said, check my Twitter. There it is. Boob. Somebody says coward in all caps. Uh, yeah, something my mother taught me. Which is? There was a old saying, Yeah, there's a fine line between bravery and stupidity. I would rather be smart and alive, that very brave and stupid and dumb. You were dead, so we all get to choose. All right, So the Debs, the Democratic Party to eat it the about Russian war was a symbol of weights of privacy. And here's the thing. Are they wrong? Right? I mean, George Washington, you may love you, George Washington, and you want to keep here your dollar bills, new quarters and your Washington D. C and all that insert. I certainly understand that, but it's hard to escape the fact the owned slaves. It's just a fact. So, you know, I can criticize a lot of things, but I can't really criticize someone who doesn't want to be surrounded by you're reminders of slavery. It's not the most unreasonable thing, even though it's terribly impractical to change things, and it makes people upset a to the same time. Yep, there were not many. There aren't that many cases where you can so easily see the other side. Yeah, this is one where you could save yourself. I totally get it. Why people say that's too far. George Washington special Don't go that far um, you know, it's complicated. You know, People were perfect back there has to be viewed through the the lens of history. I totally get that. That's a completely reasonable argument. I don't disagree with it a bit, but I completely agree with the people who say, You know, I think you'd like this because I wouldn't. So, uh, I could definitely see both sides, so I think that's just a question of power. You know, wherever the power is exerted, uh, it will. It will determine the outcome. Speaking of power, uh, let's talk about the thing that everybody is thinking. But you don't want to say it aloud and get banned from all platforms, I guess. Which is one of the odds. This turns into an actual shooting revolution, because the interesting thing is that the protesters are quite brilliantly avoiding gunfire except at each other. So the only people being shot by protesters are other protesters. Apparently, now that is surprisingly good discipline, don't you think? I mean, that's it's sort of scary how good the discipline is. And the reason makes sense because as lovers, they have numbers, but they don't use guns. The other side is gonna have trouble using guns against them because it would just increase their numbers. So they have sort of this check mate kind of thing, where if it's just lots of humans, with maybe some clubs now and then and you know, some dirty tricks, but no guns, it's just gonna be hard to control them. If your only tool is guns, he's shooting them would make them stronger. It would. It would bolt, you know, boost their argument. But on the other hand, it has always been true and probably always will be true that the government is whoever uses the most force. So if the if the government in name, you know, the one that you think of as the government now is unwilling or unable to use the most force that whoever is willing to use the most force becomes the government. So right now, the way they use crowds against smaller numbers of arm to people who will use their weapons there, what would stop them? What would be the thing that stops them because it's working right and people keep doing what works well, the only thing that will stop them is force that had to be a force that is, violence began not recommending not I'm not saying anybody should do anything violent. I never recommend that What we're doing is sort of thinking through what is the logical ramifications of of what you're saying, right? So it's more just a prediction. So things you know, I always say there's no such thing as a slippery slope because it can't slip forever. And if we rethought how we treated George Washington, that ended up being you, sort of where the line got drawn. In retrospect, you look at and say, Well, you know, something stopped it. But the only things that stop it that I could imagine because they're not looking for concessions, right? If the protesters were looking for something that that they could get, you know, an actual specific delivery herbal, Uh, and then you could give it to you. Say, Oh, well, it's like a strike by a union. As soon as they get what they want or the best that they can get, then they go back to work. But these protesters are not like a union strike. There's not really a specific thing they want except more and Mauritz, not something you can satisfy. Yeah, because you can't just give Mawr. If the response is more and more so, there's no way to negotiate an end to something that isn't a negotiation and can't be by its nature is just a power is basically a power move and the only thing that will stop in his violence. So if there is none and again, I'm not suggesting there should be a but it will just sweep through the country and become the law of the land would obviously destroy the country because the the main difference between the left and right is an understanding of incentives and had to build a system. Republicans, We're going to building systems that are a little bit cruel by objective standards. Which is, Is capitalism cruel? Yeah, yeah, it leaves people behind, but it works better than other systems. That's the only you. The only thing you can say about it is it compared to the alternatives, it's way better. It's not even close, but it has lots of flaws, of course, anyway, So that's the big difference is that there isn't any way that the lefts of view of how the world should run could actually work. That's one of the reasons that I am not jokingly in favor of living the chop occupied zone. Let her run in a little bit. You let it let it play out because they say to be. But Scott people are being killed their you know, we've had several shootings and murders in that area, but it's only a few. I know that sounds cold, but you know, it's an area that has a few burgers every year. This is more than normal, but what would be the alternative? What's the alternative if there's no way to get about without force that leaving them there and having them basically discovered that they would like a better system, it might be the least the least damaging way toe game this out in the long run for the least loss of life. So it might be that they just need Teoh have enough of a bad experience, which would include death, and but it's not. It's not even the number of people getting a shot or killed that would make the big difference. Imagine living in this zone where you see people walking by open carry you know, they've actually got guns, you know that there was a shooting the other night, and you know that you've kicked out the police and you live there. So what if your especially if you're a woman, you get a little extra risk if you're a woman. So what are they thinking? What are the women in child thinking when they see that has become, uh, you know, the law of whoever has a gun or whoever decides to be the most violent. So it seems to me that letting it run a little bit May if you were to fast forward into the future and say to yourself, How is this gonna look? You know, two years from now, when we're looking back at the moment, Republicans Air saying some version of President Trump is not showing enough? Uh, force not showing enough leadership. You sort of standing back and letting that the mayor's handle things that may turn out to look brilliant. Somebody says I have a blind spot about this. I think it's about the Marxist plan to take over the world, so I don't have a blind spot about that. In fact, everything I've said is compatible with that. But I think that's what you're talking about. Um, so and you also have to factor in the odds that there's a foreign influence over the protesters. Now. The odds that there's attempted foreign influences 100% the odds that it is successful, it's, ah, variable that matters. Let's say that Russia or China or anybody else Great Britain. Yeah, that it was impossible. And could they do it easily? The answer is, yeah, it's possible they could do it easily. And they have. They have motivation to destabilize, at least in the case of Russia and China. All right, So, uh, I laid a little trap on Twitter that finally sprung, and it goes like this. I made three claims in a conversation in which a lot of Hollywood artists were involved. As you know, artists are my natural enemies. So whenever I say anything on Twitter that gets the attention of other writers, authors, artists, musicians, they will attack. But they're they're always a hilarious and their attacks because they can't even really follow the point. Usually, their attacks are just completely irrational, which is completely different, for without a lawyer or an engineer usually comes after me. You know those air, those more rational attacks. They're either right or wrong. I agree or I don't. But when the artists come after me, it's just it's just sort of crazy nonsense and it's more fun. Teoh do that. But anyway, I use a technique that I've written about, uh, in which I said three things. Two of them are easily checked and I don't think you I wouldn't get as much pushback from But the 3rd 1 set people's hair on fire because it's a little ambiguous. Now when I say it's a little ambiguous, I mean, reasonable people could look at the same information and say themselves. I totally disagree with how you're interpreting that, that when you can create a situation like that where there is a difference of how people interpret the same data and it's something that matters, that's a good fight. So if you're trying to draw attention to something, have I taught you the doing something that's a little bit wrong? But it's close to something that's right is where you get all the attention, simply making a claim this true or false doesn't get the same attention as something that's just a little bit wrong. Darn it. You should have known it. How can I fix this, kid? I correct us for you, you fool. How could you have made this mistake? So you're with the claims I made? Uh, it wasn't a threat about some discrimination against African Americans in Hollywood, which I'm sure exists. Of course, I wouldn't doubt that, Uh, because it exists everywhere. So So I just added context. Now, wait, where do you see the breath of this play here? You might appreciate the complexity of it. All right, uh, so I said that I lost two jobs in corporate America for being white and male. You've heard the stories of those were true because they told me directly to my face, you cannot be promoted because you're white veil. So I left both of those positions eventually because I had to. I couldn't be promoted. Um, but then I made 1/3 Clinton. That's a little sketch here. Now here's the part. That's the fun part. Of course, I know it's sketchy. That's why I did it. So I included 1/3 part because it draws attention to the other two. So that's the play. So here's what I claimed. And by the way, this clave is as good as a lot of other claims that people would consider legitimate, which is what makes it sort of a good prank that it falls into that category of, Well, maybe so. I claim that I lost the, uh, the Dilbert TV show that ran on U P N for because about White Creator with the right a white product. And the context is that U P N. Decided to do a focus on African American audience right after my first season, in which the Dilbert TV show and good enough ratings within the U. P in the universe and good enough ratings to be renewed. Now that's pretty good. But you know, I don't know what percentage of shows ever get re dude after the first season. It's not terrific, whatever that number is. So just to get renewed, it's pretty big deal now in the animation world. It's a much bigger deal because here's the thing with ah, live action, you could adjust as you go because you see what you're getting while you're getting it. In other words, you could have your actors do a run through of the script. If it's not funny, you change a few lines, and by the time it gets on television, you know, you've really refined it in real time. But if you're making animation, you write it, you add the voices it gets sent off to, I think South Korea at the time animation happens, and you don't see it again for months. And the only thing you could do, for the most part, is, uh, hot extra stuff to get it down to size. But you can't really manipulated after comes back. So unlike live action, you've got a six month wait before you could make your first adjustment and and we didn't make adjustments so we'd get it back. And we think, Oh, wow. I was sure this would work because it looked like it looked good on paper, but it didn't work. Once I got to the screen, so I'd say, All right, I'll do less of that. But I have this thing I didn't think would work work really well, so we'll do more of that kind of thing. So by the second season now, both these were half seasons, but that's a detail you don't need. So the second season we had corrected all the things that worked good in the first season, so the second season was much better. All right, so here's the set up first season. Good enough ratings to be renewed. But the content? I would say it was just all right. It was pretty good. But the second season was actually quite good. And in the world of animation, that demonstrates, you probably have a pretty big hit your hand. But that's that's the type that they decided to be the African American network on. And we lost our time slot because it wasn't a administrative communication error, as I was told, Well, I think there was some of that involved. But don't you? Don't you imagine that Dilbert would be the show that would lose its times lot because that's how you kill the show. You move its time slot. That's it's well known and TV world that if you move some things time slided, their ratings plummet. That happens pretty much every time, unless you're moving it to like a premium slot that it could go up eso the ratings plunged because the time slot was moved at the same time they were considering being an African American network in which Dilbert would obviously not be the right product. So was racism involved? Hard to say. Isn't it hard to say? And I wouldn't even make the claim. Except I don't it lights people's hair on fire, and it's very much of the type that you hear all the time. How often have you heard someone else make a claim? Not me, but somebody else. Make a claim of discrimination and you listen to the story and you say to yourself, Baby, you could be But you know what else it could be? You know what else it could be? Could be. You're not good at your job. So what did people say to me? Whether I when I made that claim, the writers and the artist went crazy and they said, No, it's because you were good Sconces Show wasn't good looking your ravings in the final final year, which, of course, is my point, too. Once they moved the type slot, the ratings good out. So of course it gets cancelled. It got canceled for low ratings, but had low ratings because the time slot was moved. Why was the time? So I moved. Well, I can think of one reason would have made sense of their strategy, which was stated to be an African American programming that work. So now that I've got people's hair on fire from this sketchy klehb, that of course I can prove it's exactly like all the other things that can be proved to my ears. So if you like to know how it sounds to me when I hear somebody make a claim, I just taught you that's ourselves. It sounds like I don't know, Scott. I think maybe your shell wasn't good. Maybe consider that That's exactly what it sounds. What I hear other people's complaints. And let me be perfectly clear. It doesn't mean your complaints are wrong. It doesn't mean your complaints are wrong, because I don't know if my to was right a role I actually don't know. Can I prove that I was disadvantaged in any way? I can't really. So if somebody says sky, you can prove that I have to say, Guess what? That's the fucking point. That's the fucking point. Now let's get to the fun part. Uh, this allowed me to draw a lot of fire. What happens when somebody who is a trained persuader draws energy to themselves even when it's negative? Yeah, what happens when you draw negative energy to yourself? Well, you could be like Joe Rogan, who draws both positive and negative energy, and he just made 100 billion deal $100 billion deal with Spotify. So that's what he did with negative energy. You could be like a candidate Trump who turned negative energy into the presidency of the United States. You could do that, or you could do what I did. And that was to set a trap for Ida B. Wells, who she's been covering race for the 16 19 project. She calls herself that Beyonce A. Of journalism. This is just in her profile, Uh, and she is the co founder of something the 16 19 project. Yes, so she writes for The New York Times Magazine. So she was involved with writing about race and racism, and she replies, May Ah, did that year was he was her first, replied Waas. Uh, you're absolutely right. That is why white men are totally underrepresented in supervisory positions, high paying jobs, corporate management. I mean, they're practically unicorns now. Was there anything I said? This suggested that I believed that senior management was divers. 100% of what I said agreed with her comment, which was There was no diversity. There's not much diversity in Hollywood, right? That's that was the whole reason. The U P and thought, Well, let's be an African American network. The whole point was they thought it was an under filled category. So everything she's saying is what I say. In fact, that's why I lost my to corporate careers. I lost them because there were so many white people waiting white men in senior management that they said, Hey, too many, You know, we've got a hold off. So that's why I lost by banking and my telecommunication jobs. But the other thing that everybody accused me of Waas asking for pity and running a pity party to which I say I've never asked for petty. Have you arrest? Have you ever heard me asked for a sympathy? I'm just telling you my story, but a waiting for the good part. Here's the good part. I tweeted I'd obey Wells comment her 1st 1st government. I think that was her second cabinet, actually. And I appended to buy, uh, profile and asked people to say if they had a similar experience of being discriminated against because they were white and male. Do you think anybody had any stories? Well, let me see how buddy we've got so far. Let's see on this waas the culmination of the whole point. So there about 1600 comments and I just scrolled out can catch somebody in the middle. So these were people who said they were white bed who were discriminated against, Lost a job for it. Almost all of them who say that they were told directly. All right, so almost all of these were told directly. Um, let's see. Yep. That happened to me. Yeah, when I was a state of play, but, uh ah, I have all these rejections saying the same thing. Exactly. The same thing happened to my dad, but, ah, as Police department once applied for a job of ah, the wrong demographic. Same here. But, uh uh, I was I was passed over by for less experience, but, uh, so just on my little, uh, Yeah, you can see in the comments. So here's Here's the red pill of all red bills Ready for it. It's the red pill of red pills. And by the way, what I'm going to say next, Uh, I couldn't say until I had set up this chain of events so they could post this tweet in context. So I had a contact so I could tweet it and say, Anybody have the same experience that I had to create a whole series of events Just to be free to say that is that we have freedom of speech. Yeah, the way other people do. Uh, and now I can say this. It's one of the biggest discriminations in the world against white men. But the trick that is being played on us is that if you lost a job because you're a white man, well, fuck you. Because they're a Richmond that are not you. You understand that reason right? You were passed over for a job so your life was impacted by a racist decision. There's no one you know. They were trying to fix a past and justice. We'll get that. And in fact, I agree with some reverse discrimination. I'm not even opposed to it. I'm just saying it exists, and it's way bigger than you think this that the fact is that white people have not been allowed to complain. But here's what you got wrong. Once, once things got to the point where George Washington's being torn down and and more Mount Rushmore is being threatened now, it is no longer a power imbalance where if you're a white male, you just couldn't talk because you were considered part of the elite and you just you didn't have free speech. But as your power in society subsides and it's happening in real time right now, you know the power of being a white male in the United States. Would anybody argue is is that least heading in the direction of Lower? So whatever you thought it was before, it certainly go lower so that that frees up some free speech because whoever is the most downtrodden in our society gets the most free speech. All right, the president, the most powerful he has to be the most careful, or she has to be the most careful about how they talk But if you were at, let's say a black man in America, you can kind of say anything, right? You kind of say anything because traditionally, you've got so much working against you that people will say, Yeah, yeah, okay. But the more presumed or actual power you have, the less free speech, You just works that way. So I can say now something I couldn't say before, which is that although I'm not personally complaining, it was a serious events which led me because I had enough options to succeed in a better way than working in the cubicle. So for me, it work out great in the long run, right? I'm not sure it works out great for everybody else. But what I would like to suggest is that it is super racist to overlook all of the white men and others, not just white men. But a number of the examples were Asian Americans and women who are having the same experience. Uh, so it wasn't just white men, but if there's a massive amount of serious direct discrimination, your God and and the reason given for it is that you have to pay for the sins of some strangers who have also white skinned, which is the most super racist thing you've ever heard in your life. Super racist. But we can say that now. I couldn't really say that before, all right, so that was the whole point of that. Had I felt bad because there were actually some well intentioned people who were tryingto figure out if my example was real or not. And I felt bad because I was kind of pranking, you know, pranking people with that third example. But the third example was to draw attention to the other two. Third example might be true as well. I just don't know, I don't know, but I know that it got people's hair on fire. That's what I wanted. Here's an interesting factoid. The Iranian budget is fifties. No, they haven't income for the government. So this is what the government has to spend. Oil revenue and tax income combined 57 billion. So that's the annual amount that Red has to spend. 57 billion. Their budget is 480 billion. And the problem, of course, is that oil prices are low, but also that their economy suffers from the sanctions. So how long can Iran just continue as a country if they're making 57 billion year but spending 480 billion. And I have to think that they're gonna prune back their support of you adventurous terrorism just cause they can't afford it. So is the President's plan totally working? Because it sort of looks like it iss sort of Looks like squeezing Iran is totally working. I know, I Let's say I'm sure I had a few other things out here. Ah, yeah. So Tic Tac just got banned in India. Do you know how big a deal that is? So Tic tac was abandoned in the love with 50 other APS that Chinese connection because it allowed china toe gather data, I think in spy on people and God knows what else. So how long do you think tick tack is going to last in the United States? Tik tak Tik tak, you get tic tac? How long do you think tick talk is going to last and still be legal to use the United States? E I don't think. Look, now here's the most interesting thing that came out of that. So, uh Balaji Street of Awesome and DeVol Ravic card. If you don't if you don't know, there's to Dave's that you don't know anything about Silicon Valley. But I just I just veg it. Two of the smartest, both successful people, that Silicon Valley. And they said they're open to looking at business plans, investments for people who make AH competitors er, an American version of a competitors to these Chinese APs. So goodbye, Chinese abs. So no matter whether or not the government bans the Chinese APS, and I think that's just a guarantee, I can't imagine that's not in the pipeline, and I can't imagine it's not gonna happen soon, so that's probably gonna happen. And it looks like the smartest people in Silicon Valley just just put the green light on, uh, business plans for competitors. So let's watch the smartest people in America. Uh, just just take that off the table. Just take those APs just right out of the game. That's not gonna happen right away. It probably does require that the government banned the ones that were coming from China, but capitalism, it's gonna do its thing. Um, so Washington Post global opinion senator cared Atiyah. So something she said recently was quote in a tweet. I guess I think she took it down, but that we said white women are lucky that we were just calling them carrots and not calling for revenge in this instantly tweet. Now imagine. Imagine if you were not a black woman who's an opinion editor at The Washington Post. Who else could say that it's still keep their job? She deleted the tweet, but I can't imagine ah white person being able to say that keep their job. So keep an eye on that. Uh, that's a little freedom of speech that some people have that not everybody has. So I I was complaining about the treatment that the Daily Beast gave to Van Jones, and I was saying that so their claim was that he had advised the White House of the police Reform executive order, and then he had said good things about it on TV without disclosing that he had advised them on it. So I had said, you know how disgusting of the daily beast. People don't brag about advising the White House. It's just not done. And if he likes the out cub We'll just Why not? He liked the L. Cobb. What's he gonna do? Say he doesn't like the outcome when he likes the outcome. So I would say it was it was just a hit piece over Nothing but that Van Jones clarified they had nothing to do with the executive order and that they apparently they reported they saw him going in the White House. He's been He's been nowhere near the even Washington D. C. The entire story was just made up. The entire story was just bait up. Can you freakin believe that for the Daily Beast? They just picked the guy to do a hit piece on and literally just bayed up stuff and then wrote it, wrote an article of the stuff they made up. It doesn't just make your head spin that the daily Beast is still there In business people, people read it and they think they're getting news and stuff. They think that there's something you're really in it. It's this kind of vibe. Ugly. Ah, Anyway, so that's what that's a little about. Uh, yeah, yeah, Somebody had. The convents is making me laugh. Speaking of the Steele dossier, let me ask you this. So this is where the second cycle of or is it the third? If you can't Ukraine indirectly of Russia being pulled into American politics, who has an interest in pulling Russia into American politics? Who has that interest now? You saved yourself. Obviously, the Democrats, the Democrats haven't interest because it works pretty well, gets their base fired up through a little more Russian stuff on there. And I would say to yourself, Yeah, yeah. But I would say that Democrats are somewhat agnostic about how they attack the president. I feel is if they would use whatever they thought work, it could be Russia could be something else. But it is really the Russia stuff. The strongest play. Think about how badly the Democrats got spanked on the whole Russia collusion thing. Do you think that they would say, You know what? I'd like to do the Russia collusion thing again. Let's do some or Russia stuff. Do you feel a Ziff? That would be there. Just logical go to Could Bay can't rule the deal. But let me ask you this. What other country would like us to be anti Russia? So people are saying China because it does that fit. I would where China like the United States to be anti Russia. Well, what would we do? Eso You still say you're China? What would the United States do if they thought Russia was more of a threat? Build more weapons, build up our military? Does China what the United States to build up its military even if the point of it is that part of the threat is Russia, baby? Maybe that so who would be a country who would like the United States to build up his military but would be sort of, uh, concerned about Russia? You somebody who's had a connection to, for example, the Steele dossier? Yeah, Great Britain. Great Britain is the obvious suspect because Great Britain can only survive if the United States, and through its NATO efforts, has a huge military deterrent against Russia. Because who else threatens Great Britain? Is it France? Is great Britain worried about France? No, not at the moment. Germany go no, is Europe The Great Britain in particular worry that Russia might get a little adventurous? Yes, it is great. Britain worried about China probably a little bit, but they gave him, You know that they were friendly with hug cause like, Yeah, you know, it's it's a deal. You take it back. We said we'd give it to you. So given that the Steele dossier and a British connection and it feels like they just come up a lot and it feels as if anything that directs the United States public opinion against Russia and against the President Trump who they but you think is a little soft on Russia. They got a look at them first, don't you? So I'm not saying I'm not blaming you, so obviously I don't have any inside information about this. I'm just saying, if you're just looking at the board and you say, uh, here's a coincidence. Russia Story. Russian story, Russia story. You think if it worked really well the first time you'd see more of it, but it didn't work. It was sort of an embarrassment. Or did it work? I know. So I would at least say, let's keep that in mind. All right? That's like out for now. And I will see you tomorrow, and I'm gonna try to make the interview with Carson work. I think I figured out what I was doing wrong. It was my under problems. It will try that tomorrow. And I'll see you then.
