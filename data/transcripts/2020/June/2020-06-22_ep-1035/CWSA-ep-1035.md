from bump, bump Abobo Boom. But but But hey, everybody, come on in. Can somebody tell me what the hell time it is? A serious question. There's no joke here. I don't know what type it is. Could somebody tell me, Is it uh, seriously? What time is it? All right, Well, um, I thought I had another hour, but I'm having a bit of a Apparently, the time is not different in Arizona. I've been here for, you know, half a day got here yesterday, so I'm in the the free state of Arizona. Um oh, my God. I so true story. I got here yesterday and Christina said, You know, it's a The time is an hour different. I thought, really, it's an hour difference. I thought I didn't know that, but turns out it's not in our different The things I don't know. All right, well, I don't have my cheese. She with me to do the proper toast, but I do the and believe it or not, I have not memorized that. I can't memorize things. Um but I would like to join you in the simultaneous IP. Will you join me in the simultaneous sip All you need is well, you know, you need cup mug glass. All that stuff go. Oh, you know, if it wasn't for, uh, uh, a message from Joe Manako on, uh, or manic Joe, Uh, Twitter. I wouldn't know that I was supposed Teoh to be on here. Now, it's not exactly my honeymoon. For some of you know, I was supposed to get married in May. Bought? Of course, that wasn't really a good time to get married. So both our honeymoon and our marriage plans keep changing. So we're just gonna I think we're gonna go asynchronous. So I'm wearing the ring we just decided were buried. So yesterday we just looked at each other and said, Why would you say were married? We've got a marriage license. If you have a marriage license and you have rings and you've agreed to get married, what exactly does the ceremony do? We're still gonna have a ceremony, but we're still still figuring out where it went. Yes, as somebody who's answering in the, uh, in the comments. I did vaguely have it in my mind. There's owner was only half of the year. They had a time zone change, and I didn't know if I was in the half. However, let's talk about the news. That's why you're here. You know, you're so are you as amused as I am by the statue stuff, you know, on one on one end, you're probably alarmed because you know, these statues air coming down all that. But on some level, does this not remind you of a Star Trek episode? So think about the statue stuff and think about the fact that the the country is in something like a civil war between roughly the left and the right sort of, but not really. So you've got this sort of weird virtual civil war. But instead of attacking each other, the left is attacking statues. And you know that the right is gonna tax, um, statues eventually, right. You know that. You know this somebody on the right is going to treat this like a chess game. And they're going to say, Hey, the leftist, taking all our pieces, they took our Washington or Jefferson or our Teddy Roosevelt. And they're going to say, Well, was statue could we take So this morning, I tweeted that. Don't be surprised if the right treats this like a chess game just like the left is and goes to take one of their pieces. It won't be a person. It'll be a statue now. I cheekily said that the right would be coming for their king and I capitalized King. I capitalized King and people still don't understand. What I was talking about now is somebody said, Hey, Martin Luther King was actually Republican or whatever. None of that matters. No that matters. And by the way, I'm not recommending any statues being taken down. I am. I'm opposed to offensive statues, but I'm also opposed to taking them down by mob rule instead of some more civilized way. But I also recognize that if the civilized way wasn't working well, they are just statues in the end, you know, if somebody tears down the statue that half of the country is deeply offended by and they couldn't get it done in some other mechanism, and they tried under know if anybody tried. But if they tried the other mechanisms and they didn't work, it's just a statue. It's not something that a lot I'm gonna die on, but you know that the country is always worried about the slippery slope, and if they take down the statue, they'll take down this and they'll take down that. I'm pretty sure that eventually people associated with right or not even on the right, it might be Just People who want this to stop are going to say, Look, you can either have it all or you can stop Now you see the choice. You can either have it all. In other words, get everything you want, which is that anybody who has a sketchy background, you can't have a statue and the right might say, Let's play by your rules. We accept we accept your standard So you would expect that they would take down Martin Luther King statues. Now, I'm not in favor of that, obviously not in favor of any of the statues being taken down by, you know, citizens acting on their own. But it's gonna happen, and maybe that will be enough for people to say, Whoa, maybe we've gone too far. But here's the thing. If if we allow that what's happening is somehow acceptable because of the offense historical offense, you're gonna have to go after the ideal Ecologists because, as it turns out, as people are saying in the comments, I think Yale is named after a slaver. A slave trader. I think New York is named after a slaver. Princeton is named after a dictator. Literally, uh, Harvard. It is named after a slaver. Now, in what world would it be okay to leave those colleges with their current names? Stay. I think Leland Stanford was a for Stanford University. I believe he was a a massive racist, and I think that's documented. I don't think there's a question about it. So Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Princeton is different cause that's a dictator. But who likes dictators right now. Suppose you had to statue to somebody who had been accused, incredibly, of me to stuff. Could you keep a statue? Do somebody who is actually kind of famous for me, too ing if that's the standard, just got to go. It has nothing to do with, you know, whether you liked or disliked anything else that Martin Luther King get. Is there anybody who dislikes it? I mean, if you're talking about the the primary message of Dr King, I don't think there's anybody in the left or the right disagrees with the basic philosophy. But if we're judging the people in their entirety, standard is the standard. So we'll see how I think the people, maybe more associated with right are just trying to stay out of it. Have you ever been Mawr impressed by the political right in this country? I've never been more impressed. And this is again one of those situations of the dog that isn't barking. So here's the dog that isn't barking something like 40% of the country associates with the political right conservatives, conservatives have entirely, um, just step back and said, Let's let's just watch this, Let it play out, see if some of the energy will come out of it. Play it cool. You know? Load. You gotten clean your gun. Don't use your gun. Don't provoke. Just be ready. Sort of standard conservative thought, you know, don't do anything crazy, but be ready. Very conservative thing to do. So I'm actually amazed that things have gone as far as they have gone with almost a complete absence of the political right being on the street. And when they are, they don't seem to cause trouble nor did they seem to be the recipients of trouble? I mean, maybe some minor skirmishes, but nothing. Nothing important. Ah, service. Okay, that's pretty funny somebody. So, what about the Clinton library? Yup. Yup. The Clinton Library. It's got to be on the list right again. I'm not in favor of the library being removed or taken down. I'm not in favor of any of them being taken down, but if you're gonna be consistent, you kinda have to go there. So let's see if the country was to go there. Uh, I'm down for that. Anyway, the reason that this is thes Statue Wars is like a, by the way, did anybody did anybody else make this connection That the statue situation is basically a giant chess game? Because they are just like giant chess pieces. They're literally, like giant chess pieces there. Two teams and they're moving their chess pieces. In this case, the left is capturing a bunch of pieces from the board. And how simulation Weird is it that the statue you would first think of as being like the primary? Um, the primary respected statue on the left does Martin Luther King, in his last name is literally King and that the right almost certainly you should. You should just assume that somewhere somebody is planning to take their cane. They're actually going to take their king now. I don't know if it will happen. I don't want it to happen, but I'd be kind of surprised if somebody didn't take it. Run at it. Now here's why. It's like a Star Trek episode, one of the first original star treks. One of the most provocative episodes that just has stayed with me since I was a kid is there was an alien to alien species that the crew of the Star Trek encountered in which they were embroiled in a war. But they decided ages ago that they didn't want to have a war with real destruction, like they didn't want to destroy their cities and their stuff. But they knew that you couldn't win or lose a war unless people died so they would fight the war with simulations. You're just a simulated war. And then when there was a result, the losing team would have to volunteer X number of citizens to be to be suicide ID. Basically, they go into some machine that vaporizes them so that everybody is just sort of civilized. Agreeing, Ah, darn, we lost the simulation. I guess 40,000 of our people have to go into the into the suicide machine. And and they decided that, you know, it was just better than regular war because you couldn't get rid of war people. People wouldn't ever let you get rid of war. So if you couldn't get rid of it, what is the most civilized way you could do it? And that's what the Star Trek imagined is a civilized way you could have an actual war. And the reason that it's stuck with me so long is that it is logically impeccable, meaning that the solution these to you alleged or ah, imaginary well alien societies came up with is actually ah, 100% better than regular war. There's no doubt about it, but it's so awful that you can imagine it, which is what makes a good episode. So, uh, anyway, in in a different way, it's not a perfect analogy, but what I see the left and the right, fighting with statues like a giant chessboard, it feels it feels to be like that Star Trek episode where we figured out how to fight a Civil war without the normal consequences. It just feels like that. I just can't get that. All right. See, it ends of fake news is hilarious today because they don't have much to work with. When when the news doesn't serve up good red meat about the president, they're gonna take whatever meat they have. So if CNN does not have, you know prime steak that they can chew on to criticize the president, they'll take. They'll take hamburger if that's all you got. And only had this week was hamburger. Here's the 1st 1 about half of the stories, I think, something without of exaggerating. But by far, most of the articles and opinions and stories on CNN dot com are about Trump's rally, uh, audience of size. Now. Is there anything less important than that in the whole world? Is there anything less important? Then a campaign was hoping that lots of people would show up. Some people expected that a lot of people would show up, but we're in the middle of the pandemic, and here's the part that they never mentioned. Have you ever heard anybody mention this, or is this the first time you'll hear it? The original rally was going to be on a Saturday night. It got moved to a Sunday. How many people who would go out on a Saturday night would not go out on a Sunday night? Because it's a workmate. The answer is a lot nodded off that anything to do with the attendance, But it's a pretty big factor. I would have gone on the Saturday Maybe I had my I had my sitter lined up. You know, I didn't have any plans on Sunday, but Saturday was marked out. And then the president says, Ups, that's that's June teeth. Let's move it to the next day. Well, not everybody has such a flexible schedule that they could just move it, so that's got to be at least part of it. And I don't think I've heard anybody say that. That's got to be at least what he percent of the explanation is that they move the date. You can't move a day and expect all the people to show up a way, so there's no story there whatsoever were in the middle of a pandemic you didn't get a good attendance at a place that would probably kill you because people wouldn't have masks on their shoulder to shoulder. There's just no story there, but they're they're trying toe make something out of it anyway, On the other thing that they're trying to make something out of nothing is when Trump said that we should reduce testing because it's making it look bad now, the fact that Trump's advisors and folks I have to tell the media that he wasn't serious? Um, no, he's not serious, that we should plunge the country into ah ah health nightmare, the way of which we fully understand so that he can look good temporarily. He didn't really ever say that, right? I mean, he didn't need it. He said that he said the words jokingly, but the fact that they're making news about something that is obviously a joke everyone, it was gonna be, um so there's that. So I was looking through John Bolton's interview transcript. Yeah, because I didn't see alive. I just wanted to read it cause would be faster. And he is the doubles guy. I I actually really shocked that somebody with his level of intellect, as comes through on the transcript family. The only thing I know about John Bolton really is a few public surface see things a little bit about his resume, but I don't really know too much about a bit besides that. But when you read a long form interview where he gets toe, you know, actually talk and explained some things, my jaw was dropping and it wasn't that I disagreed with him so much. It wasn't that My opinion is different. It's a doesn't seem smart. I don't know if he ever waas, but when I say smart, I don't mean in the book sense. You know? I'm sure if he if we did a test of who knew the Who knew that most leaders on the most countries Heywood smoke me, right? Yeah. Who would know the history of blubber? Bob, You would smoke me. So I'm not saying he lacks knowledge. Probably knowledge wise, he's one of more knowledgeable people are out, so he's very knowledgeable. But I'm gonna walk through some of the things he said in the interview to tell you how stupid there. All right, so no particular order, um, here we go. Um, but here's something that, uh, I always joke about this as the creator of the Dilbert cartoon. I can't tell you how many comics I've written because it's quite a few on the subject of there's always that one dumb employees Who says, But what's our strategy? Have you been in that meeting? You'll be the meeting and you're talking about stuff and you know, you've made some decisions. And then there's that smart, dumb person, and I think that's what boldness. He's a smart, dumb person. There's, I think somebody else has it in for that. But the smart, dumb person in the room says, Excuse me, Excuse being boss. What is our strategy? And everybody just goes, um, and they don't know how they is, right, because the smart, dumb person has taken the high ground, but it's a fake. I ground there's no such thing. A strategy strategy is the thing. It's a thing we think is the thing. That's why the smart, dumb people bring it up. But the smart people don't. The smart people know that the strategy is the thing. Yeah, there are. There's some obvious things everybody knows you want to Dio, for example, does the United States have a strategy? Well, whether you call that his strategy or not, would we all agree that the United States wants to be prosperous once have good trade deals? What's Piece wants to influence other countries, doesn't want to be in big wars. I could go that list. It would be a pretty long list, and you would say, Yeah, yeah, that's That's what we want Those are all the things we want And then you say, Well, how do you get them? Well, here's the thing. If this if the environment is changing every day in every moment, what's your strategy? You can't have a strategy when things are changing all the time. Every moment there are some basic things. You can dio that after the fact that you could label them a strategy, for example, the United States is as a pretty high priority on education. We think it could be even more, but wouldn't you say the United States tries to educate its population? Is that a strategy? Kind of kind of. You could say that's a strategy, but since everybody agrees and it's obvious, do you call it a strategy or is it just something that's obviously good to do? The problem with the people who say you have no strategy is they're smart dub. There's no such thing as a strategy. And if you had one, it would either be so obvious that it would be you not worth saying or it would change every five minutes, so you'd have to rewrite your strategy. All right, all right. We just found out something new about North Korea. I guess you change your strategy. So all the smart, dumb people say my boss had no strategy. All right, what else does he say here and here? The different ways that he says It's so these air quotes for embolden from his interview, there really isn't any guiding principle like a strategy. Basically, there isn't any guiding principle that I was able to discern other than what's good for Donald Trump's reelection. Now, let me ask you this. Do you think there's ever been in the history of the United States? I'm just speculating. Has there ever been anybody who said a Democratic president doesn't matter which one pick your Democratic president, who has ever said, I don't think that president has a guiding principle or a strategy, probably every single time, probably every time. My guess is there's no such thing as any provident leader who does not have people saying There's no strategy, there's there's no guiding principle. There's no strategy. It's like it's like saying Air exists. There's air, It just doesn't mean anything. Then here's another quote from Bolton. I don't think the president fully understood all of the implications of what he was doing. Number one. Does anybody understand all of the implications of what they're doing? No. No. Nobody understands all of the implications of what they're doing. What kind of what kind of you know what kind of a criticism was that about you? How about you? There, in the comments, Do you understand the implications of everything you're doing? And if you don't, what's your strategy? What kind of guiding principle do you have for your life again? These are all nonsense words that you can literally just say about anybody in every situation, all right, on its mind reading. So the bigger problem is that Bolden says, I don't think the president fully understood all the implications. Well, is mind reading on top of the fact that is something that nobody could do understand all of the implications of what they're doing. Uh, and then he says, Bolin says, I think what it shows is a couple of things. Number one. That foreign policy and defence policy are not motivated by philosophy, grand strategy or policy. Uh, isn't that just sort of true all the time? Why is this special to trump? Well, let's look at this again. Do you think that our foreign policy and defense strategy have ever been motivated by philosophy, grand strategy or policy? Okay, let's take him apart. Have have our defence policy ever been motivated by philosophy. No, no. What will philosophy the philosophy that you need a strong defense of people? Don't mess with you. Like what? What kind of philosophy are we talking about? Is there any country in the world who wouldn't like a strong defense if they had the option? Know how much strategy do you need to talk about to decide whether you want to sprawl? Military? Uh, what kind of philosophy is that? Or how about the grand strategy? Is a grand strategy different than a strategy? It is a grand strategy different than a philosophy. Is a grand strategy different than a philosophy that's different than a guiding principle? It's all jargon if you didn't know how the world really works. In other words, if you had not sort of lived in the corporate world, you've never been in government. You would easily read Bolton's words and say, Whoa, this is a guy who knows what he's talking about. He's talking about philosophies, grand strategies, policies. These are things that President Trump never even he can't even conceive. He can't even conceive of these smart itude. But indeed, Trump is clearly the smarter person in the room, all right, And then I would die on that hill. By the way, I would die on the hill that if you looked at street smarts, sort of general decision making ability to understand people in the world the ability to look at complexity and figure out how much you really need to work with etcetera. I know. Think boldness anywhere in the category of Trump, Say what you will about Trump. He's diesel. You several levels above what is indicated in this transcript. Uh, you know, if you take out Trump's jokes and hyperbole and stuff. You end up with a solid decision making, but you don't get that here from Bolton. All right, and then the other thing he says that philosophy, grand strategy or policy is our defence policy not motivated by policy? This is actually his sentence. If you break that the sentence, he's actually saying he doesn't think our foreign policy and defence policy are motivated by policy. What, What? That isn't even anything. You can't even disagree with it. Don't you mean anything? Yeah, Our policy isn't motivated by policy. Oh, yeah, that's probably a good criticism of the president. Is that our policies and motivated by policy? I don't think policy is supposed to be motivated by policy. It doesn't work that way. Yeah, let's see what else he said. Um, Bolton said. I could see even before my first day, when I would go over to talk to Trump and others that this was not like a White house I had ever seen before. It was not functioning in the same way as any of the three previous presidents I had worked for. Now this is a form of criticism that I call the My God. It's different from what I'm used to, and therefore it must be bad. Is there any criticism in this statement? It feels like a criticism, right, because you you make the leap of assumption that's not present. He's simply saying that the Trump White House operated different differently that any other way house is that bad. I think it's why he was elected. I'm pretty sure people voted for Trump to get away. House that didn't operate like any prior White House. It's pretty much exactly what they voted for, and you'll see this kind of this is very much a CNN lefty kind of thing. Actually, I take that back. The right uses us all the time. How often do you see people in the right criticized the left? But there's no criticism in the criticism. It sounds like this. Well, that's the oddest thing. Well, that's nonstandard. Well, I haven't seen that before. You know anybody who's criticizing something by his uniqueness or its newness without reference to anything wrong with it is just not somebody you should listen to anything. It means they were not even. They're not even having a brushing association with reality or the truth or trying to convince you or persuade you it's just noise. Um, all right, here's something else that Bolton says the president should read extensively. The material he's given. It's not clear to me that he read much of anything. Is this a true statement? The president should read extensively the material that he's given? Would you agree with that statement? Do you think the president should read extensively the material he is given? And then boldly went on to complain that the president would talk to advisers outside the little ring of advisers in the White House and he would get external opinions? And that bolted into where these opinions were coming from so he couldn't kind of deal with them or control them for, you know, in the quietest chaos, who is the idiot in the room? So you just heard this criticism. So Bolton says, And let's let's accept that this is true, because I think this is true. The president should read extensively the materials he's given. It's not clear to me that he's read much of anything. I feel like we've heard enough reporting from enough different people that we could agree he does not do a deep dive under reading. Okay, so let's take that as a fact just for a conversation purposes. It's a fact that the president does not do a deep dive of the details of the reading. Okay, who's the idiot? Who's the idiot in the room? Bouldin Bolton. Do you know why the president should not? This is my opinion. This is my advice. Should not do a deep dive on the reading and that ignore his outside sources of information because the people who give him the write ups are not trying to inform him they're trying to manipulate him. You know that, right? Everybody in the White House, any White House, every White House, every corporation, every organization, the write ups that were given to the boss, whoever the boss says, President, CEO doesn't matter. Whoever does the right up is not trying to inform the boss. They're trying to manipulate them. They're trying to move them to a certain conclusion Now. They may not say that they might show both sides, but the way things that written is for the purpose of getting result even if they swear on a Bible that that's not the case. Nobody can write a long, detailed thing without leaving out some things that maybe should have been in their emphasizing some things that maybe they think are kind of special. What is the worst thing that a president should do to be a good president? Let me read John Bolton's advice. This is the worst thing you should do. The dumbest thing you could do if you were the president would be what Bolton says, which is should read extensively the material he is given. If I could give the president any president, any CEO, one piece of advice, it would be this. Do not read extensively. All the materials you are given, it would be the dumbest thing you could do. Now imagine you're the president. You've got a zillion decisions in the most complicated world that you could imagine how much of all the decisions that a president any president needs to make can be kept in in any human being's mind and sort of processed well, the answer is not much right as a percentage of everything president needs to dio, you could pick the most genius president. Let's say Bill Clinton I think Bill Clinton and Obama very high I Q people, you would say, I think you would agree. You know, Harvard educated whenever, uh, that these air smart, smart people who can hold a lot of detail didn't matter. Did the amount of detail that Obama could master Did that translate directly into better decisions? And if so, can you point to one? Could you point to a decision that was better because any president did a deep dive on the reading, the reading material and the background of the historical significance? No, no, I don't think he can. I doubt that's ever happened in the history of the world. The you didn't look at my right up is what the low level, smart, dumb people saying. Every organization, every smart, dumb employee of every corporation says. I tried to tell the CEO, but he wouldn't listen. I couldn't get his attention. He seems motivated by his own career. As far as I can tell, he doesn't even have an interest in strategy. Every smart, dumb, worthless employee says that about every leader, the only way you could survive the president's job and I have I have the least little will say an opening into that world. In other words, there probably only a few of you here. Percentage wise, it might be a lot of numbers, but percentage wise, very few, if you were watching, have had a career or a job that I would say would be as complex as the president's, or even as complex is mine, because at any given moment I've got three careers running simultaneously, and all of them have, you know, thousands of variables. So I live in a world that is so unbelievably complicated that the only way that I can navigate it, which I do successfully, I think, is that I pay attention to the least about amount of information I can't. So the way to survive immensely complicated situations that are just ever, ever complicated. They don't ever simplify. And you've got You've gotta find a way to navigate through this all the time and make the important decisions. You really have to find the smallest bit of information that can get you to a good decision. So it could be bring my two advisors in who have different points of view. Give me give me 10 minutes arguing and you listen to him and he go, Let's say you're the leader, you're listening to him And one is I'm gonna pick two people randomly. You don't have to agree that these air good characterizations, but just just go with me here. Two people, two advisors come in the room. One is Peter Navarro, who I think is kind of brilliant, actually. If you listen to him talk that you don't think he's smart dub When you reputed Navarro talk, you think I think he has sparked smart, smart book wise sports. Streetwise, smart, reality wise. So Peter Navarro is smart, smart. So he comes into the office with John Bone, who is smart up and the president sitting there. And Navarro. Let's say it's there on different sides of some topic, and Navarro says, Here's my argument, Bubba, Bubba Bomb. Here are the three things you need to know. Two of them are really important. Mr. President, focus on these two things. The other things are important, but not nearly as aboard these two things. Can the president hold two things in his head? Sure, sure. Peter Navarro just broken down for him. Peter Navarro did the deep dive Peter Navarro in this example. I told him what the two important things were and that needs is he wants to check this So he asked Bolton. Bolton says. Nope. Totally disagree. Here are my reasons, but about my reasons. And here my two reasons or three reasons. Well, I think Peter Navarro is wrong now what surprises that do. He's got two opinions and their opposites. They're opposites. Well, does the president say, Let me go with the smart, dumb guy or let me go in the smart, smart guy. How hard is it to agree with the smart, smart guy? If the alternative is the smart, dumb guy, it's no hard right? You listen to Navarro's some range ***. That's why I need to know. All right. And how did you know I frame this? Alright, got it. That's about as deep as you can go. If you're the president Now, the bigger the issue, the more time you want to spend more people. You want to talk, so I've highly simplified it. But if you think being president is a process of reading all the materials, you've never lived in any kind of a complicated world because reading the materials will mislead you and take way too much time. You need people to break it down for you to give you the argument the way the news will make it To give you the argument the way President she might see it. You know, you could break these things down into pretty simple elements. And while I do think it matters some of the context, you so you know what the other side is thinking? Why can't your advisers just tell you that? I suppose you've got Bolton coming in saying the president, he doesn't read my materials. And so he doesn't know that I'll just pick a random example that he doesn't know that North Korea traditionally says expert, then does Why why can't you just tell him you're in the room? Just tell him that. So you know, President, Historically, they say expert than they do. Why? They've done it seven times. Why do you have to read that? Who needs to read that? You don't have to read that. All right? And what else is bold to say? He said, uh, the bulls said quote. I thought that that it was almost impossible to sustain the consistent, coherent policy over time. Do you know what? Do you know what situation makes it impossible to have a consistent, coherent policy over time, every situation, every situation. Nobody has a consistent policy over time. They always change. It changes with the facts that changes with the better argument. I don't know. You should always be waking up every day and saying, Did the policy that we were doing yesterday's I still make sense today? Did anything change? Um, did you do? Here's something that Bolton claims in his book. So the interviewer asked, You say in the book that Trump asked General John Kelly if Finland was part of Russia or thought Venezuela is really part of the United States. Come on. The president did not ask anybody If Venezuela is part of the United States, if you're dumb enough to believe that you're dumb enough to believe anything else in this book, which would be strategic mistake, Um, so can we agree that there isn't the slightest chance, really. Zero? Yeah, there aren't too many things I would give a 0% chance to being true. Some, he says. Are you sure? Yeah. So what I'm saying is mostly most things I say. Well, you know, 90% chance. It's true. 85% 98% if I'm really, really sure something that might say 99%. But let be break with tradition for a moment. Let me Drake break with tradition. The president 100% did not ask if Venezuela is part of the United States. And if you think there's any chance that happened, you should not watch my periscopes because because you're not gonna understand anything, there's no chance that so if you know it's in the same sentence with, uh with Trump asking if Finland was part of Russia. Um, now, how do you feel about the Finland one now? If the Finland one had been by itself in that been the only allegation, he asked if Finland was part of Russia. Here's what I would have assumed. I would have assumed that he was asking if Finland was sort of under the You may be virtual sway of Russia. He may have asked something like that. You are they you're part of the circle or it was something like that. Now I can see that being possible. But did that? Did Trump actually ask if Finland was like you? Officially a part of Russia? No, no, no. I won't put 100% of that. So I'm gonna be consistent. Can I say with 100% certainty? The president did not say Hey, this Finland part of Russia. He may have said the sentence, but that doesn't mean that you meant it. Literally. Part of Russia, as in Putin is the head of Finland as well. It could have been you. Are they on their team on this particular question? Are they in the Are they a satellite of influence? Which, by the way, I don't know the answer either. Is Finland in the circle of influence from Russia? I don't know that. Do you anybody answer that question? I actually don't know the answer. Somebody says many Finns speak Russian but dislike Russia. Right. I think you will see the, uh um somebody says, Was he being sarcastic? Well, we don't have any evidence of that, but you can easily imagine him saying something like this rhetorically. So imagine if somebody say is Well, we could do this in this country. Oh, no. We can't do this in this country, you know, because because Russia has too much control of that out of the country. But we could put a, uh you know, we could put in, let's say, a missile defense in this country, but we can't do it in Finland. Okay, here's Here's a hypothetical. I'm not assuming anything like this happened. It's for your imagination to imagine something that could have happened that would sound like this, but was different, all right, so it's just type of thing just for imagination. Imagine they were talking about where to put a missile defense, Um, thing. And they said, People are tossing out some countries. Well, how about put in Czechoslovakia? You know, lovable, yes or no? Not Jekyll's lock. You but Czech Republic, whatever it is it, um, And then let's say somebody said Finland. And then it was rejected. All right, so you're the president. You're listening to People debate what country and somebody says about how about Finland? And then someone said, Enough now you can't do Finland. Can you imagine the president saying rhetorically? What is Finland part of Russia? You see, it is Finland, part of Russia in other words, it would be rhetorical to say, Why couldn't we put, you know, talk to Finland about taking it? You know, our missile defense or a NATO base or whatever the fuck they were talking about, right? So you can imagine lots of ways it could have been you interpreted differently. Uh, but we weren't there, so we don't know that, Bold says. But there was an unwillingness on the part of the president, I think, to do systematic learnings so they could make the most informed decisions. It were was John Bolton actually inside the president's brain, and he could. He could find out that he was unwilling to do systematic learning. Maybe he thought that systematic learning was not the way to go, so he might have been unwilling to do it systematically. Now, what does systematic mean in this context? In this context, it means that John Bolton wanted to manage the president. He wanted to be the one who gave the president materials that were approved by John Bone, which of course would support inside. And he was the president to spend a lot of time looking at the materials that John Bolton gave him the president decided not to spend a lot of time every day looking at materials that John Bolton gave him. Is that because the president is defective? Could be. That's one interpretation. That's John Bolton's. Here's another interpretation. The president didn't think that systematically looking at materials from John Bolton would help anything. Anybody been right? Uh, and then the interviewer says. But are you saying that all the decisions the president made were driven by re election? Here's a bold said. I didn't see anything where that wasn't the major factor. Yeah, that wasn't the major factor. Now how often is the president's actions disconnected from his reelection or his even is legacy? How often does the president do something that is clearly bad for re election, but good for the country? You can please name all the examples in the comments I'd like to see in the comments all the examples historically, where a president did something that was clearly bad for re election but good for the country. Go, uh, crickets, crickets, crickets, crickets. So he says, Lincoln, that's a deep That's a little more complicated. I think. League Lincoln had a game land with everything he did. Yeah, the atomic bob Know that was good for re election. Economic shutdown. Now that the the alternative was worse there there basically is no situation Obama care? I don't know. I don't think so. Lock down. You could. I think every single decision, um, is compatible in the sense that the presidency is pretty transparent. If the president did something that was just clearly not for the country, I think we wouldn't notice that. So ridiculous. All right. Ah, here's something else Bolton says. Uh oh. Here you go. He continues on. It was not something that started with a strategy of how do we want to see the threats from China to Russia resolved on arms control, for example, what does that sentence be like? Like what? Does I actually need this just jargon, isn't it? Uh, way didn't start with a strategy on How do we want to see the threats from China and Russia resolved on arms control, for example? Well, I'm no expert on arms control. Bility. Throw out some assumptions. We would like them to build fewer weapons that could kill us. My clothes. Is that the whole strategy? Because I think the strategy of arms control is that we negotiate and try to have fewer weapons. Is there is a deeper than that. Am I missing something if the president tries to negotiate with another country for arms control? Uh uh huh. Is that, uh, is it obvious with strategies? All right, then. Bolton says the president over and over again, seems to think that a good personal relationship with Ji Jingping Vladimir Putin came Kim Jong un the Ayatollahs Erdogan of Turkey was equivalent to a good relationship between the United States and their respective countries. And you know what? Trump's right. Trump is right now. Uh, Bolton used the word equivalent, which nobody would use. And of course, the president does not think there equivalent because nobody would to imagine that the president is the only person in the world of seven billion who would have this opinion because, you know, nobody else would. Nobody else in the world would think a personal relationship with anybody, even a dictator, was equivalent. Do you know a good relationship between two countries? Nobody would think that. But gold is alleging that the President is the only person who think that maybe, but pretty unlikely, but here's what I would say about that. I think the president has been proven right, not in terms of the being you identically equivalent to the country's relationship. But there is no doubt that the president's let's say respect, for she allowed him to negotiate harder. Now he realizes that that didn't work, but it was certainly worth more working on. If you're gonna negotiate with somebody hard first, you make them your friend because you can go harder that way. If you're gonna push somebody on trade or push somebody on your weapons or anything else first, treat them with respect so they don't have an irrational reason to hate you. So the president is smart enough about negotiations that he was to remove the personal reasons to say no. Is that equivalent to a relationship between two countries? Of course not. Nobody thinks that, not the president. Nobody would think that. But can you do a good negotiation until you've set some boundaries of respect? So you don't want President Xi to be over there negotiating and thinking to himself, You don't want him thinking to himself. I can't make this deal because I need to say face right, You can't have Putin say I can't. I can't give Trump when he wants, because it's gonna make me, you know, look, like I gave into this guy who's pushing me, right? But you could imagine the President Xi or Putin or anybody else they could make a deal that look good for their country. It was good for us. And what didn't get in the way is any personal and animosity between the leaders, because that would just be a distraction. So for Bolton not to understand the importance. And I think Trump is I really maybe he'll be the only president will ever do this, but he is just smarter about human beings. It is way smarter to treat somebody with respect if you're gonna push him hard. In fact, if you choose somebody without respect and push it hard, you should expect to get your ass kicked in. So the fashion virtually or actually all right, um, is Netflix going to make a movie based on the Bolden book? Well, who knows? Uh, off. Thank you, Becca. So I've been Arizona right now, and it's ah, it's pretty freaky because, you know, everything's open here. Their masks everywhere. But everything's open. So it's Zolder a whole different world. Um, all right, just looking at your comments here. Is Hollywood done? I don't know. What was the last time you enjoy the movie? That wasn't a biography. I just think movies Air dead. So forgetting about the political correctness aspect of movies. You know, that's That's a small pressure on some of the classic movies that center. But, uh, yeah, they're not playing golf. Sorry, I just lost my train of thought. Pascal says a digital thing is coming. What's a digital thing? All right, um, any statues taking down in Arizona? I don't think that's gonna happen to the Arizona. It's a pretty well armed state, so we'll see. Somebody says Hollywood is done. I think Hollywood might be done. You know, if you look at the me too ing, I don't know how Hollywood could survival that all the B two stuff. Somebody says they like Morrisville movies. You know, I did like the super Super powers types of movies, but they're kind of kind of old. Ah, my writing another book or your wedding vows. You know, most of my extra energy is going into the locals platform. So I'm putting my extra extra energy and content there, and they will be more overtime. Just sort of working it out over there. What? That's gonna be all right. That's all for now. And I will talk to you tomorrow.
