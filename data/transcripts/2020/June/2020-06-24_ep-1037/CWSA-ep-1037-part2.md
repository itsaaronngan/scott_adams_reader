And that is there's a look on cool bears face which, if you're a trained hypnotist and you've seen if you've triggered lots of people into cognitive dissonance, there is a physical look and cool bear has it the whole way through the interview. I'm gonna try to teach you what that look is like. All right, Um, let's dio baby, I can show it to you because if I know, show to you will be nearly as powerful. So I'm gonna call it up on the screen here. We'll do our best. See if the screen looks good on your screen. Make sure I don't have anything else on my screen. That's embarrassing. I don't think I do. Uh, so look at these two faces. They're one of them is a disgruntled, fired employees, and one of them is experiencing cognitive distance. Bolton looks like a guy who is just, you know, disgruntled employees. That is a completely normal look for a guy who just isn't too happy and he's expressing it. Colbert, look in his eyes. Look at the smile. You see, they don't fit. The look of the eyes is crazy, and the smile doesn't fit The eyes. That's cognitive dissonance. That's cognitive distance. So and let me see if I could do an impression for you on here. Sorry for the people listening to this. You're gonna miss it. I'll try to explain it. I'll give you two looks. One is me concentrating on something that's right in front of me. And then the 2nd 1 will be it looks like I'm in the room, but my mind will be in a hallucination. All right, so the 1st 1 is ordinary person who's not hallucinating, who's just looking at something in front of them. All right. So look at my expression. You can tell from my expression that I'm present. I'm just Yeah, just looking at you. Nothing that we're not. All right. No. Now imagine that. I'm recounting to your story of President Trump who in your mind, as has created this imaginary is this imaginary monster is completely divorced from reality. Imagine that you've gone four years knowing that he would destroy the country. But everything that could be measured is better. Of course, we took a hit with the Corona virus, etcetera. But nobody would argue that Trump did not preside over a strong economy with good unemployment. Nobody will argue that it's not gonna come back fast, at least as a percentage, even though it might take us well to get back to the top. No one would argue that the stock market is low. Nobleman would argue that Isis still exists in terms of holding territory. Nobody would argue that we haven't pulled down our troop troop numbers. You could. You just keep going. And the only thing that have is maybe ran up the national debt, which is not the strongest argument for Democrats because they would, too. So imagine you're living in a world in which everything you believe about the world four years has disproven. It's disproven. After four years, nothing went wrong. Everything that you could measure went right. So you have to actually hallucinate something wrong, which they dio. They imagine that the president's inner thoughts are wrong. So let me know. Doing depression of somebody who's in cognitive dissidence will take off my glasses and they're having a hallucination while they're talking to you. It looks a little like this. And then and then the president that the president see the eyes when when the eyes are in imagination Boat And imagine the president as this crazy clown. He's running around. He's he's trying to kill everybody. There's there's a there's a look and the and the smile will be Why smiling? Cause I got a sociopath. Look, just like my My eyes were not smiling. Right? But I've got a smile. It looks like a sociopath, but the sociopath Look, um, the socio path look is very close to the cognitive dissonance. Look, because I don't know what the sociopath, this thinking, but the cognitive dissonance is your having a hallucination, and it's coming through your face and your face is distorted because it doesn't know how to. We had a deal with the hallucination. Now you want the test. Here is the test. CNN's, uh let's say they think about all their hosts. I'm gonna name names. And now you've seen the look right. So you saw it on Cool Bear. You saw it on me, and I will go further and say that when they're not talking about these topics, they don't have that look. It's about the topic that gives them the look. I'm going to name some hosts from CNN and you tell me which one seems to have a normal look. I'm just talking about the news. This is on the news. This is what happened on the news and which one seems to have something wrong with the eyes. Alright, alright. I'll just name names. Some Dr Sanjay Gupta. Just imagine him. Chris Cuomo, Don Lemon. Anderson Cooper. Um Jake Tapper. Um uh, Brooke. Uh, why my Brooke Baldwin? Um all right, now all those go which, which one of those people exhibits You're all getting it, right? Yeah. Anderson Cooper, Anderson Cooper has the cool bare face. Uh, Chris Cuomo. Yeah, if they I could see why you're guessing, but yes, Stelter or no Jake Tapper? No, Um, Don Lemon. No. Believe it or not, Don Lemon does not. He does not exhibit the cognitive dissonance dissidents face, which might mean that he believes what he's saying, and it seems consistent with what he sees. Well, this is going to freak you out because now that you've seen it, and by the way, you'd have to be a trained hypnotist to recognize this or at least be experienced. But now they I taught it to you. You're going to start seeing it and watch how easily you spot it. Now that you can see it, it's gonna freaking out how easily you can spot it. All right, let's see if I have talked about everything I will talk about didn't miss anything, anything else happening. And let me let me reiterate the fact that cognitive dissonance is not does not measure your intelligence. It doesn't measure your knowledge. It doesn't even mention it doesn't even measure your intentions. So there's nothing about Anderson Cooper that I think is anything but smart and well intentioned and well informed. I would say all of those things about him. But it is nonetheless true that when he talks about Trump, he gets that a look on his face that is not common to any other reporting. And I think you've seen it. Somebody says AOC, yeah, the ones that are hard to tell are the are the ones who opened their eyes wide when they talk sometimes, so you'll get a photograph that looks strange because he caught it right that moment. So Cory Booker, um, and air see you sometimes have photos are wide eyed. It's not exactly what I'm talking about. It's not just your eyes were wide. There's a there's like a glassy stare like you're not in the room. That is the tell. All right, Um, does anybody think that Bolton is laying a glove on Trump because it doesn't feel like it does it? That doesn't the Bolton book feel like it's just ground Hog Day? And it's another guy saying stuff happened in the room, but nobody else heard it. And in a month in a month, you won't even remember that book. Somebody says no fair teaching and LP to the uninitiated. So somebody is. They have no sense train around here. What's the next big red pill? Well, if you were on the locals platform, you would already know the answer, that question. But because he answered, If you're gonna stick around for a moon, I will read to you the parts of the rent bill because I documented them on locals. So if you ordered it in writing, that would be the place to go. But I'm gonna read it to you. All right, so here's a list of things that have changed. Um, you people arrested me. If Adam Schiff has the look. See Adam Schiff is the same problem he has. He has wide I look and that that one can throw you off. So just having you know, wide eyes doesn't necessarily be in cognitive dissonance. It's a little different than that. So So I told you that the big red pill coming was not gonna be one event or one thing. It would be a bunch of things. Here's the bunch of things in my list. Number one Experts are far less reliable than we thought, and that changed a lot in 2020. Yes or no. The public's opinion of what experts know and how much you should trust them is completely different in 2020. Are you with me? That's part of the red pill, Just a small part. But all of these collectively will make you doubt your ability to understand your reality the way you used to understand its number one we trust experts far less. That's a fairly new change. Number two project very tacit. Showed us that Facebook literally is doing everything that conserve this thought they were doing Israel. Yes, I will add this. Flynn has been all the charges were dropped. So the Flynn thing is another part of the red dome. Number three. We know that individual scientific studies air no more reliable than horoscopes. In fact, half of published studies turned out not to be true. Now it is true that studies collectively in overtime work, science toward knowledge. But if you look at one study doesn't matter what but usually in the social sciences area is what we're talking. But if you look at one study, it's useless now. You used to think, Well, it's a study, right? Even just a few years ago, you said, Well, it's in the It's in the news and it's a study. I know sometimes they're not really, but probably 80% chance Israel. Now you don't think that, dear, What do you think is the odds of any study that's in the news? Just in individual study that's not backed up by other studies? It's a shocking new claim. What's your first thought about how likely it is true? Well, it used to be about 80% right now, a little closer to 20% isn't big difference. Um, how about we? And now we know that, of course, defund. The police will never work. You know, you already knew that. But I think other people are just learning that the slogans like defund the police don't translate into anything you can actually do. Um, you can, of course, improve the way they do their job. You've learned the stories about nooses and hate crimes are more likely fake than riel. In fact, the Wall Street Journal did a study on talked About a study in which they looked at all the hate crimes reported and 2/3 of them were fake. 2/3 of hate crimes are fake. Do you think it's 2/3 or higher? You think it's higher, don't you? That's different. If you had sent to me two years ago, there's a hate crime reported. This is that is a true or false, I would say, Well, I'll have no way to know but 75 80% chance is probably right. What do you think today? 10% today, if you see a hate crime reported that you haven't heard the details yet. You just heard somebody is reporting a hate crime. What's the first thing you think? Maybe it would be horrible if it were true. 10% chance is true. That's part of your red pill. Uh, how about this? Um, we're starting to understand that if he calculated reparations correctly, they would be a negative number. Because if you if you do the right calculation, you would study black people who came to America against their will as slaves compared to the income of the people who were not taking the slaves. And what's the average of the people from the country or continent where they came from? And how are the Children of the people who are taking the slaves doing income wise down? As soon as people realize that and a few people already are, reparation starts to go away because even if you think there is a different way to calculate it, of course, people will. People are not gonna automatically agree that I described it right. But the fact that that conversation is guaranteed to happen that it should be a negative number pretty much takes it off the table. Um, how about the fact that we're very close? We're not there to realizing that there's no such thing as Racists? What? What did you did I just say that there's no such thing as Racists. What I mean is, everybody's racist, so there's no such thing as, Oh, that guy's a racist, but you're not. No. Now that's not a thing, because you can't be not racist. In fact, you can't be not biased on any topic because your brain is a pattern recognition machine, but it's not good at it. It's not good at recognizing patterns. It sees confirmation bias as a fact, just as easily as it sees the fact this effect. So you can turn off the basic working of a brain. You can just find ways to overcome it and and and ways to do better and use your higher powers of reasoning to recognize it and build a system that tries to squeeze. That helped the bias. But it's it's now borders on stupid. At this 0.2020 it borders on. Stupid to imagine that they're Racists and non races. That's not a thing. Everybody, everybody is racially biased in one way or another is universal, and I think it's more important that we understand that because then you could work on the right solution. The wrong solution is trying to fix the way people's brains are wired. You can't fix the basic wiring of the brain. You could just fix what you do, which is fixable. Um, we now understand, or we're coming to understand that the news business isn't even trying to be news. It's just being naked advocacy. I don't think people knew that five years ago people didn't know five years ago that the news wasn't even attempting to be news. I mean, it wasn't even in there in their first choice. We're learning that conservatives see the news of both left and the right. And so anybody who is only sampling the news of one side is in low information voter. And because the news on the left is sort of more universal, it always bleeds over into the reporting on the right, the people in the right to see the news on the left and the news and the right. It's a fuller context. Even if they choose toe, you know, think one is more right. So I think the left is about ready to realize that they're low information voters because their own news sources air completely corrupt and they're just starting to figure that out. You know, the Flynn thing? That Russia collusion thing, this is little hints are starting to come together. Um, the New York Times is docks ing that this blogger I told you so. That removes all doubt about the press being on the side of the people. Didn't you used to think that the press was on the side of the people, You know, Maybe Maybe you never thought that, but people did. People thought that the press was on the side of the people. The New York Times has removed all dep by Doc Sing a person that they were going to write a positive article on and they were still going to ruin his life just cause it's this story and they were completely, completely transparent about that. We know that black lives matter is a racist movement that is creating a preferred victim class. Now you probably thought that from the beginnings of if you did on, not everybody is there yet, but that's what's forming. It is very clear that a poor white kid who became a poor white kid for no fault of his own should not be put in the lower class of victim. There's just no argument for it. And I think that red pills emerging. We saw the Russia Collusion Hoax. The Charlottesville find people hoax and other hoaxes. Um, you've learned that much of the news is speculating about mud in my dreaming. Once you understand that the news is mostly mind reading, but poorly you recognize it everywhere. It's like Wait a minute, that's not news that you imagining. You know what somebody's thinking. That's not a thing. And now you see it, um, some of you have learned, but not all of you, that hiring the best people isn't really something you could do except by luck. If you're the president and you happen to be a very provocative president, who even the people on your own team don't necessarily want to work for you because it's too much heat, you don't have a big pool to pick from. If you don't have a big pool of candidates, the best you can do. And this was true with Trump the best you can dio just take your best shot and then fire aggressively. So if he fires aggressively and he's picking from a limited pool because just people don't want to be associate ID, especially could dio. People are understanding that slowly, uh, people are understand that that if you hear a book or a report about one person who is in the room and heard something shocking But the other people in the room didn't hear, it didn't happen, right? You used to think, Well, maybe happened. But now you know that that anonymous report or even the non and on this report like Bolton, nobody else heard it, huh? Is that funny? Nobody else sort of that. That means it's not true. You're learning that disgruntled employees always talk the same way. Doesn't matter if Trump fires them or the CEO of a company fires them. That CEO has no strategy. It's all chaos, everything. He doesn't look into the details. He doesn't understand the finer points of all of the smart things. I tell him. Every employee, there's nothing political. There's nothing about Trump. Every disgruntled employee is that same broken record. All right, we've learned that China is not our friend that never wants to be. It's not even close. So, uh, decoupling is coming. We're learning that the technologies we thought with the greenest might be the worst. In other words, nuclear power might be the greenest of all. So that's a that's a switch. We're learning slowly that the planet is probably warming, even even skeptics and the planet planet is warming. But there's a growing body of smart people. Michael Shellenberger, for one, will be talking about him a little bit more, whose great new book is out Apocalypse, Never about 3/4 through. It is terrific. It is the best. So let me recommend this is Michael Shellenberger is brand new book, Apocalypse Never, and he goes through all of the environmental arguments. But here's what's different. He gives you both sides. I don't think I've ever seen that before. Like, quite objectively, he actually gives you both sides. And when you're done, you have a completely different understanding of all of this stuff. You really will. It'll blow your mind. Uh, then there's ah, just for a funny one. I said, Socialism only works if your mom pays for your cell phone. So the experiment in the autonomous and I think has been very successful for everyone except the people in the autonomous zone, because it told the world that what they're asking for isn't a real thing. It's not something that can work. Oh, if somebody is telling me that Michael Shelled Berger's book is not out until June 30th. I got it. I got a preview copy, so But I'm sure you can pretty order it. And I think he would appreciate that. All right, um, the Lincoln Project Twitter account. Yeah, it's tweeting all the hoaxes. Um, that's just looking at your that your jazz was sort of a mini Stanford prison experiment. Well, that's a That's a funny, a terrible thing to say for one month. Free locals. I think I have that option. I was thinking about doing that. Um, you should link to Amazon so you can get a kickback. You know that there's not very big kickbacks. What about parlor? Somebody says so. Parlor is the one of the competitors to Twitter, but it's tiny. So if you do what I do for a living and you try to sell books and stuff, you have to be on the big platforms. That's not really an option. So I would be very expensive for me to get kicked off of Twitter Um, but here's what I'd like to see. Can somebody build this for me? If you'd like an idea for a project, there is already something called Hoot Suite. Who too sweet where you can. You can schedule your tweets and your post to social media, but I'm pretty sure that does not include the alternate sites, such as parlor, such as locals such as Rock Finn competitors such as Bit Shoot. I don't think it includes all those. So here's the product that needs to be built. It's a private where you could write your content and, uh, and then you can just select all the platforms, the big ones and small ones, the alternate ones, which is more than anything does right now. And it just sends it all of them, because until you have the one software that sends it to all of them, it just be too hard for people like me to to have a Twitter laissez presence but also have some kind of a presence on an alternative site. All right, so right now there's not really there's not a practical way for somebody in my position. Did you say I'm done with Twitter I'll go to this tiny platform that none of you are seeing there. No, you know, the president doesn't use etcetera. But if I could publish to all of them, I would be sending all of my same traffic to every source. Maybe maybe the software has to adjust it if it's being posted in a different place. You know, maybe Twitter as a limitation of characters, but Facebook doesn't. You know, you'd have to have your software tell you you know where your content will fit. You could adjust it so physical. But once you have that, somebody says it has been done. I doubt it. All right, Whatever I say, there's something needs to be built. Somebody always says it has been done. But if you looked at that thing that somebody says has been done, it's just never, never the thing. It's just something reminded you of it. Um, I would know about it by now. All right. Uh, and if yeah, who it's sweet is first of all the user interface, I found impossible. Actually, I don't know if it's improved since then, but years ago I tried to use Hoot suite, and they found it so frustrating that it was basically unusable. In my opinion, other people have had the same opinion and whose sweet does not, I think, does not connect to the alternative platforms. Probably only does the big ones. Um, yeah, if it's been done tweeted at me, it will take a look. But I will say with confidence of 99% that if it's been done, it's not done to a commercial level or it doesn't have all the platforms or something. Um, somebody says you can is just not simple like you want, right? It's a simplicity which makes it a product. Yeah. Other people are saying the same about the user. Your face for hoot suite. Uh, pineapple on pizza. Being guest. I say whatever you want. Uh, social be. I don't know what that is. Somebody joined parlor and likes it. Uh, somebody's asked me about tests. Corona virus test versus hospitalization. So right now the hospitalizations are released, the Corona virus people have It is going up while the rate of death is going down. And I don't think we quite know why do we? It could be that the testing is finding more people who have low symptoms. But that wouldn't tell you why the death rates going down could be that the old people are hiding better. It could be We know more about ventilators. It could be. Who knows? I don't know. It could be the some of the meds they're using or more effective than we know. It could be the sink. Who knows? But one possibility is that is that the rest of the cases from this day forward will be, ah, lower version of death. It's possible slaughter meter right now. Is that 100% slaughter meter is not a prediction, because I always add this following caveat if nothing changes, but something always changes. So there will be lots of surprises between now and November 3rd, do you have any idea how many people how many big things we're gonna drop between now and november? Third a lot. Um, somebody says the fragile ones were already dead. They can't die again. I think it's probably a whole bunch of little things that are adding up to it. We're smarter at all those things. All right? Uh, yeah. Biden obviously has some cognitive problems. Somebody says there's no zinc and the vitamin aisle. It won't work. Well, I know. I ordered some by mail that she took a long time to get here. All right. Did any celebrity die from Corona virus? Yeah. That's the test I've been using to know how scared I should be. Because the odds of me being the first like household name that dies from Corona virus is very small. So it's just this weird little trick I'm playing with myself to say. All right, if there is no other celebrity person you've heard of who died of it? I know there've been a few, but they were once I was not familiar with. Then I'm not gonna worry. Have you watched the circus? I have not. But I might. All right, That's all I got for now. And I will talk to you later.
