but pump pump pump from boom, boom, boom, boom boom pump, pump pump Everybody bought in. It's time for coffee Was got Adams. I tried to recreate from memory the simultaneous sip preamble. I think I got most of it. Right, but we're gonna try it in a moment. I hope you're prepared. You know what she'd think you do? All you need is a couple of Marghera classic anti injectors. Last goblet. Jealous or staying a vessel of any kind. It's not the same as usual. Schilling with your favorite liquid. I like coffee. Enjoy me now for the unparalleled pleasure, The dope being head of the day, the thing that makes everything better, including systemic racism. It's called the simultaneous Separate. It happens Now go. Don't you feel better already? I know I do. So let's talk about all the fun news. All right, there's lots of it. Here's that. Here's a little news bit that you probably completely missed because news likes to focus on the important stuff. Such as What is the exact shape of the handle you use on your garage? Important news like that, but one of the things you might have missed is that the Trump administration want a big court victory about hospital price transparency. Meaning that the hospital has to tell you what stuff costs before you go in. So you could do a little shopping. Uh oh. I forgot. Tankard. Yes. Take her jealous or stayed? Yeah, I think that's right. So put these three things together. You've got this victory in the hospital price transparency. So the Trump Administration is gonna allow you to shop better. Or at least we hope that's where it's going. Shop A better for price for hospitals, that should lower prices over time. The we also saw the change for telehealth where doctors can practice across state lines. In theory, if that becomes permanent, they think it will. There's more chance than a will that it won't. Um that should lower the cost of a doctor visit both for the doctor and for the patient as well. Now I think there's something going on also with pharmaceutical costs. I'm not up on that, but imagine if you will, that November comes and Trump can say the following We got you telehealth. We got you hospital price transparency and we're doing something on drug pricing I don't know what that would be. That's a pretty good story. That's that's very different from I didn't do anything about health care. It's very different. So that's good news. Let's like that bubble Wallace, of course, of cores. Uh, so we learned yesterday that the FBI looked into the issue of the noose hanging in African American driver. About Wallace is Raj Bay, and the initial story was that summer racist. Put that noose there as a racist sign to the to the most famous, I think African American NASCAR driver. But here's the thing we just learned. First of all, the new said bed there for months before, before any of the garage base that have been assigned. So the FBI has concluded with certainty that it was not any kind of a racist act against bubbles. It is a news, or at least in shape, like a news, but it's the rope that hangs down that you pull the garage door closed with. So yeah, it's a news, but it's it was put there for a purpose. Now I have something to tell my black audience today. Here's something you might not know about white people When we see a news, we don't think race. When I see a noose, I think a Clint Eastwood in Hangem High. I almost always think of some kind of old Western where, uh, where bad white people are being home. So if you would say and I think maybe Bubble Wallace might be wondering this because, as he said after he learned that it wasn't directed to him and he agrees, he said, There's still a news. I mean, still straight up. It's the news, and I would only add to this. That's probably exactly what it waas meeting that whoever tied it. Oh, all you know, I could tie it in a variety ways. I'll tie it in the news. But the thing you have to know is, I don't think any white person tying a rope into a noose. It even crosses the line that there is that any kind of racial element to that act. It just doesn't seem racial. It literally seems like an old Western where old white guys air getting home. We just don't connect the dots the way the African American community would. Now maybe we should Yeah, that's a different question I'm just saying we don't have I personally ever tied ropes into, um into nooses. Yes. Yes, I have. I have I've spent quite a bit of my time as a young kid teenager when I was like, you know, tying ropes and, you know, you just be practicing different knots and stuff and you're a 12 year old kid. Of course you're going to try to make a noose. You know, of course, I learned how to do it properly because it was just something we saw on TV all the time again, having nothing to do with race because it was always bad criminal white people or being hung on TV. So I'm Here's what I say. First of all, Bubble Wallace is completely cleared, in my opinion, from having done anything wrong or even being wrong, because it turns out he never saw the news. It was reported to him by Steve Phelps, who's the NASCAR president who came to him crying. And I assume just gonna assume that the president of NASCAR was a white guy so the white guy can't comes to Bubba says, I got to talk to you in person, and he's the president NASCAR, and he's crying. He's so disturbed, like, genuinely disturbed. And he tells him about this. Roque that looked like a news. So Bubble Wallace never saw it. He was he was taking it from somebody who thought he had interpreted interpreted it correctly. So I see nothing in this story, which we should hold against Bubble Wallace. Everybody on board with that bubble, Wallace gets a free, absolute free pass because he was acting on what he was told by a very credible source that just turned out to be wrong. But it was a credible source. I can't hold it against him for believing a credible source. You can't hold it against him for buying into a let's, say, a narrative that is suggested by current events because you know, everybody's thinking in race terms, it wouldn't be a surprise. Would you be surprised one bit if some races somewhere, did a racist thing in public or to some public figure? No, I wouldn't surprise you at all, because the temperature of the country has been turned up so much. So bubble Wallace, you get an A plus for having nothing wrong. You didn't do anything wrong. in this case, in fact, but I will give I'll give him one of one piece of advice. The way Baba seems to be treating this is that, um he knows he's could be mocked for a hoax, although the hoax was not his doing and certainly not his intention. But he knows he'll be mocked for it. And his approach, at least his initial approach was to, you know, act like it doesn't bother him and channel that energy into his competitiveness. Now, that's a good TV answer. Yeah, I'm not gonna let it bother me. I'll put it into by a sport, so that was good. You like your athletes to say stuff like that, but let me give him some advice. This is the way I'd go with us. I would say totally. My bad. So that's the first thing you do. You should dio you should Do you know, um, it was my bad. Even though I had information that led me to this conclusion, I accept full responsibility. That's number one. And then here's the Here's what he I would recommend. If I were advising him for public relations, I'd say Let's look on the positive side. Look what happened. Seriously. Look what happened. He had immediate complete support from everybody in NASCAR. And I would say that the country was completely behind. And I don't think there was much in the way of racial division. There are lots of people who thought the story was fake from the jump, including me, but we didn't really hold it, you know? Way. Didn't have we have a racial opinion about that? Exactly. We're sort of waiting for the waiting for the information to come out. We knew there's some role, but infield necessarily like a racist thing, maybe more like a mistake. Like the Oakland alleged nuisance turned out to be just exercise equipment put there by an African American man. So, um, somebody says he saw a picture of it. Hey, did see a picture of it eventually, but I don't know if you saw a picture of it at the time, and I know we didn't get a picture of it. So is that a way? So here is the point. Uh, I think you should look at the positive, Which is that the way people reacted was the way you would want people to react if it had been riel. So I think his response was you could have been better, But he wasn't being advised by a public relations person. So he was just being a real person. I told that I do not hold that against him. You think he or they will apologize? No, I don't know. No, no, no, I'm not saying that. I think they will apologize. I'm telling you the way I would handle it if I wanted to. Commander this with the best reputation as I would go right at it directly. Totally. Rob, I was totally wrong. But look at the reaction. I mean, you're missing. You're bearing the lead. Yeah. The small part of the story is that I was wrong. That's a small part of the story. The big part of the story. Look at Well, people reacted to that. That's that's how I would've played it. All right, um, and by the way, I do think it was a news, and I do think it was tied to resemble the news. But like I say, it was probably just done by somebody who was just tying knots. Um, did I hear that one of the three presidential debates has been canceled already because of a Corona virus. And I ask you, Is there any chance that will be any presidential debates? What do you think? Because the first ones canceled. And sure, that could be actually just legitimate health concerns. I mean, why wouldn't there be, you know, if he would be weird if you didn't have health concerns about that. But don't you think all three are going to get cancelled because the Biden team really needs them to get cancelled? Am I wrong that if Joe Biden goes into a debate, it's It's gonna be a bad situation for him. I think they have to at least extend the scare long enough to make the debates not happen. That's got to be the key trajectory for at least the key strategy for victory for Biden. Did you happen to see the God awful campaign that that I didn't just put out which he's sitting in? This, uh, looks like he's behind some kind of business and like an alley like place where maybe there's some tables that perhaps the employees smoke cigarettes at whether or not working, it didn't even look like it was a commercial place was looked, looked like he was in the back alley with, like, six people with masks. And he had his mascot wrong. And he's falling asleep in his chair and saying a few generic things. And I thought to myself, Compare that because you know, there were advisers, right? This is a video that they chose to release that they filmed this. The Biden, the Biden campaign itself filmed it, and they chose to release it that when you see it, you're going to say to yourself, Are you telling me that professional professional campaign advisers I thought it was a good idea to do it there, the way it was done with just a sparse crowd in this dingy, you know, terrible optics that somebody thought was a good idea in the first place that they felt it. And then after they saw it, they still thought it was a good idea to make a commercial out of it. Does that is that feeling that right now compare that if he well, to what I told you in the best past month or so cobbler, Harris seems to have improved her messaging and communication game extraordinarily, which is a strong tell for some kind of a world class adviser or more working with her because you can see the transformation and you don't get that from your sister giving you advice. Whatever happened with Kabul? Eris. That's not from you know, your friend gave you some tips. That's from somebody operating at the highest level, who's who's helping her transform. And she's succeeding now. I had predicted years ago when people said now she's not good enough I said, Just watch, Watch what happens when you get close to election time and watch your transform because I believe that she could. She could learn skills quickly. That seems to be an indication that she can't and I think she did. So here's what we have. We have allegedly the world class advisers for bite and doing the worst job I've ever seen of campaign advisers so bad that it almost looks intentional. At the same time, his presumed but not confirmed could could change, but presumably the vice presidential pick, who many of us believe would be the real shadow president, is getting. The best advice you've ever seen is that a coincidence that all the good advice is going to the number two spot. That was possible that Biden just doesn't take advice. You see, we don't know what's happening behind the scenes, but if you're looking for a scenario in which the number two pick which I'm still guessing will be couple, Harris becomes in voters minds, the rial number one pick. This is maybe what it would look like it would look like The number two pick is getting all the good advice. The number one pick is just sort of being pushed out there. So that's a little foreshadowing. Um, there's something happening with free speech, which is a fair statement, which you would all agree with, but maybe not. You might not be seeing what I'm seeing. So first there's the surface obvious thing. Their free speech is being diminished because, um, well, let me give you a simple so carpet doctor got permanently banned from Twitter yesterday, uh, permanently banned. Now, carpet Duncan does the beams that President Trump likes Teoh tweet. So So he is very strong in terms of messaging for the Republican side, and he just he just got taken off the board a few months before the election? No. Is that a coincidence? Is it a coincidence that has been operating for years? But when we get close to you know, the summer before the election that he gets taken off the board because he's not the only person being taken off the board, right, you're seeing some other people getting picked off? Probably not a coincidence now. I don't know about the details of why I think it had to do with the racist baby beam that got taken down. The president tweeted it. It alleged, to show a racist baby, you know, white baby chasing a black one. But then you see it in its fullness that you could see that their best friends and hugging each other. So there was something like a D M C. A violation. In other words, the original video was copyrighted, but it's a parody. It's an obvious parody, and with an obvious parody. Usually the worst you'd expect is Baby. The tweet would have to be taken down. Yeah, maybe the tweet would have to be taken down, and that's that's it. So it seems like there's something a little extreme. Also, Slate star Kotex got taken out by The New York Times. So Slate Star Codex is a very influential blawg, not political, But it may have had some content that somebody didn't like possibly. Hey, I don't know. Maybe you talked about TDs or something. So that got taken down. He had docks and he took it out himself. Basically. So he deleted it. The suit suit, an ominous was sword. Uh, the blogger who does not use his real name, took down his own blawg when the New York Times descended to docks in for no good reason. All right, so that sadly so, you know that. And you know that if you say anything that somebody thinks is a racist dog whistle, even if it isn't that you'll you'll be canceled. So that's a part of, you know, you know that people are being canceled and muffled and muted in a variety of ways. But here's the part that I'm seeing. It has something to do with that has something to do with the black lives matter stuff for some people, and I seem to be one of them. I have increased my free speech and I don't think you saw that coming, For example, I'm gonna give you an example of my newly increased free speech. Black lives. Matter is a racist movement. White privilege is a racist statement, and reparations is completely racist. Now, could I have said that a month ago? Maybe if I really couched it just carefully and said it just right, you know that. But for some reason I can say that now. And I feel like I couldn't say it a few weeks ago. But the president keeps calling the grown a virus come flu now. He, of course, knows that he's being called a racist for calling it come flu because that's, you know, suggestive of Asian culture. Therefore, it's racist now, even after he was told that he keeps doing it. It feels to be that the president is very consciously making sure that the field of what free speech allows doesn't diminish. Now I know his credits are going to say no, no, no, He's just riling up the crowd with racist dog whistles. That's all there is to it. Uh, we'll get rid of the Give it a rest, dude, fellow. There we go. Put your any misery blocked. Um, And so it makes me wonder if the Republicans are about to discover a new form of free speech or at least simply just take it. Just just take free speech and just do it. I watched the speech by, uh, Matt Gates. I guess he was probably speaking either speaking before, after the president at the same event last night. And Maggie said directly, the white privilege is a racist strategy to make white people shut up and do what they're told. And I thought to myself, I don't know if he could have said that a month ago, could it? And did you know, I looked at the home pages of CNN and Fox News and I don't even think it's a headline. Can you imagine that there was a, you know, a prominent national politician who said in public in a prepared speech that the white privilege is a racist term that's just being used to you manipulate race white people. Basically, I don't think he could have said that a month ago. Am I wrong? I'd like to see in the comments whether you think something is changing in the changing in both directions at the same time, which is that some people are getting less free speech and being canceled while there are other people were saying, All right, fuckers. Game on, which is what I'm saying. I'm saying, Okay, bastards, game up. If if If you want to bring more attention to me, just just bring it on now I think that part of the the Divide is that What is it, then? If you've been watching that Gates for, Well, what is it that mag Gates and I would have in common? I want to see if you can pick out what is different about the two of us from other situations. Now, mostly, we have things not in common that we guess, like if you're making list, here's Here's a list of all things about Matt Gates. Here's a list about all things me be mostly different, but there's one thing that there's that list that were very similar on that would tell you why we have a little bit more free speech, I think, than other people. I'm waiting for the delay in the comments to see if anybody gets it of Here's what we have in common were unusually good communicators. Now, if you are the side who is trying to silence the other side, you don't want to give attention to their best communicators. In other words, if somebody goes after Matt Gates and says, Hey, that Gates, you said that I can't believe you said this. That white privilege is actually a racist statement. Explain yourself and then you know what you would do A national television. He would explain himself so well that whoever thought they were trying to trap him would say, Oh, damn, that didn't work that did not work. He would he would take that accusation, ball it up and shove it so far. Back up their ass is that they would never want to talk to him again. Am I right? If you've watched him enough in public, you know that he's basically untraveled ble on camera, his his camera skills or just unworldly. I mean, I've never seen I can't say I've never seen anything like it. But who would you compare hiss on camera verbal skills to I don't know. I don't know. To be tough, he's kind of by himself at the moment. Now I'm for different reasons You know, I don't have the same type of oratorical skills that he does, but I'm also unusually persuasive. And if I get mad, I'm not gonna bought back down, but sort of baked into my personality. I can't change that. Um, so I would be the worst person to give attention to, and I think that that might be You know why I have a little extra free speech. Maybe we'll come back and bite me in the ass later. So I think you're gonna see some kind of a bounce back effect where, uh, you know the president and other problem that people are going to say, Hey, how about this? How about we say whatever the fuck we want and you just shut up about it and just listen because we gave you free speech. We listened to you the let me say if I had to speculate about why this is, it would be this. What? What would President Trump, Matt Gates and I all have in common specifically on the topic of George Floyd's tragic death? The one thing we all have in common and pretty much most of the world is it will have the same reaction to it like this is horrible. This is This looks like a crime. You know, we can't have this in our country, so I think it helped that so many people were, at least, um, mentally on the same side with the people who would normally be our critics. If you if you imagine the deaths of political take sides. Uh, why is everybody saying Flynn Flynn got the writ of mandamus? Well, I don't know what that is, but it sounds like something I need to look up right now. Fox News would have this right? Not yet. I guess it takes him a while to write that. Let's say, uh Flynn. New. See some Flynn news. Dismiss criminal case against Michael Flynn. Appeals court Really? Appeals court orders judge to dismiss Criminal Case against Michael Flynn The decision blocks us about Sullivan from holding a hearing to scrutinize the Justice Department's decision. Well, thank you. Why in the world was Justice Sullivan forming a new form of government toe? Look at his own decisions that definitely said so That so judges blocked that. Ah, All right. Do I understand what this means, Though? Blocks from to dismiss the criminal case. Does dismiss the true case mean it's all going? Is that what's happening? Is that Is the case completely dismissed? New? Well, let's say it. ISS say it. ISS. Let's say that the General Flynn case is dismissed. Does that call for a simultaneous sip? Do any of you have any beverage left in your vessel? Grab it. Grab it. Yes. Your cup. Your mug. Your vessel. This will be a rare secondary. Simultaneous. This one to General Flynn and all the people who fought for him. All the people who advocated for him justice. Drink down. That feels good. That feels good. Somebody says Carpi doctor who got banned from Twitter should join locals. He is on locals. So I'm on the locals platform, which also helps me to be a little bit less. Cancel a ble because I have a second place to go. It's a subscription subscription service. I hope to be talking to car pay soon about his account of locals. Um and, uh, we'll make a little bit more noise about that so you can see the importance of having a a a platform for people who get de platform on the places. All right, Well, gosh, that General Flynn stuff. Yeah. How did How did the Democrats process that? If you're a Democrat and you're looking at General Flynn, the the case just got dropped for being a complete fabrication. And it's obvious it's all part of this. The coup out of have the Democrats process that I just don't know. Um all right, here's some other things going on. Um, did you watch the project Veritas Undercover tape of Facebook employees admitting perfectly candidly and freely that they do illegally Meaning not. Not not compatible with company standards, that they violate their own company standards, too. Uh, block Trump supporting messages. They actually sent it directly. They bragged about it. They laughed about it. It's lots of people, it's widespread. And it's so it's so acceptable that the employees were involved. So no trouble at all, speaking freely about it in front of other people. It wasn't even something like a dirty little secret that they kept to themselves. They happily talked about, um, suppressing conservative voices on Facebook. Now that should be the end of Facebook in terms of an unregulated density, shouldn't it? We'll see if that happens. Somebody's asking me if locals is app or Web based theatric just came out a couple weeks ago. So it is both APP and Web based I'm. Anyway, so enough of that, uh, up, up, up Facebook, I think is gonna get regulated. I think that twitter that you have brains work, we associate things, even if they should not be associate ID. I talk about this all the time. The fact that there's undercover video of a social media platform in which the employees air saying straight up, You know, we screw the Republicans on our platform. People will assume it's true at Twitter. Is that fair to say so? We do not have an undercover tape showing Twitter people saying exactly what the Facebook people are saying, but your common sense says OK, if it's happening in one place and it's so widespread, it's got to be happening in other places. It's just gotta be so I think the possibility of the use social media platforms not being regulated I don't know. I think it went to zero last, uh, Congress is controlled by the Democrats, so free speech will end actually, officially, Yeah, free speech will end on November 3rd If, um and by the way, that's a really powerful statement, isn't it? Free speech will actually end on November 3rd if Democrats control Congress and the White House. Because now that we know with would no doubt any any uncertainty has been removed that Facebook is suppressing speech on the right. Well, you know that Democrats have got to change that because that works for them. So if Democrats are not going to change the social video from suppressing voices on the right, is it not fair to say that free speech will die in November 3rd under the condition that Democrats have enough control after that? That's a fair statement, is it? But it's also very persuasive. Uh, because it's true. If it weren't true, it wouldn't be persuasive. There's a Rasmussen poll, uh, says that black Americans are the demographic group most concerned about a shortage of police officers. So of all the demographic groups, the black, um, black population of this country is the most concerned about. Wait, wait. We're not gonna have enough police. Is that a surprise? It shouldn't be. Should that be was a surprise. No. Nope. You should not be a surprise. Um, I have a question for you. Why is that? The only Republicans worry about mail in votes being rigged. I haven't tried to weigh in on that question too much because there are some system details that I don't know that you would be. It would be easy to imagine that I understood this mail in ballot issue, and I don't and I'm not sure anybody does. Let me let me state that more emphatically. Nobody understands the mail about Belle issue. It's a whole bunch of confused stuff that we complete together, and we treat one thing like a different thing. And so I don't think there's anybody who actually understands the real risk. But they think I don't understand, is why only Republicans are worried about it, because our Republicans, under the impression that there are no local voting precincts in which Republican operatives would also try to cheat with ballots, I mean that it feels like the cheating could be about equal. Why would one cheat more effectively than another? I don't know. So there's something about the whole issue I don't understand, So let me say as clearly as it possible that I am not agreeing with the Republican position on this. But I'm also not disagree. I think if you have certainty of this issue either direction, if you're positive that mailed ballots are safe, you're not a credible person if you're positive that they're unsafe all the way to the point of changing election result. But I don't think you're entirely credible there either, unless I learned a lot more about this. So when I say credible, I don't mean wrong that I always make that distinction. I'm saying, If you're if you're trying to be an informed citizen, then you're just looking at what you know, and that's all you know is what you're being told. I wouldn't believe either side Republicans or Democrats on the topic of mail in ballots. One of them is right, but there's no doubt about that. One of those two sides is right there either a big problem, at least a risk or they're not right. I don't know which one it is. I honestly don't. If you sample both sides of the media, you will hear arguments that you know if you don't have your own knowledge about the field that I don't I hear the arguments that I go. Uh uh, that was pretty strong. And then we'll hear the argument from the other side and they'll say What sounds pretty strong. Somebody says, Don't play dumb. Don't you play dumb with me? Well, no. I'll tell you what I do know. I do know that there should be a 1,000,000 ways that you could cheat with mail in ballots. We'd all agree with that, right. There must be a 1,000,000 ways you could try. But here's the argument on the other side. You could audit them to know if there was any cheating. So you could, for example, not enough. Anybody do. That's But let's say that they suspected some cheating in some area. They could say, We're not gonna check every ballot. It's too hard, but we can check every 100 or whatever is the right number to get a sample. We'll check every 100. We'll go to the actual voter and say, Is this you? Show me your license. Did you really cast a vote this way? And if the person says yes, say okay, well, we sampled a lot, and everything we sampled look good Now, if you sample and it doesn't look good, you would. You would have determined that there is voter fraud. Absolutely. So here's Here's the question. Could voter fraud happen? I think, obviously, yes. Would it be Detective if it happened? I would say, Obviously it could be, obviously could be. Now that doesn't mean that they'll have a process in place to do that. And that's the part where you very quickly I get into the areas where I don't understand. It's like, Well, how many people are involved in heaven? We always had mail in ballots. I thought we always had him. What was really different about it is that the fact there are so many, but they do have got unidentified are in each one can. Can China print up a bunch of extra ones? And if they did, how would China print up extra ones If they need a unique identify her for each person there mail to How could they do that? So if you think you have a ah good firm opinion on this, I would suggest you probably shouldn't, uh, you know, if if I had to. Now, part of your intuition is that it's very achievable, and I agree with that. My intuition is also that it's changeable and you could get away with it, but I don't know enough to confirm them. But if your instinct this is probably a bad idea, you might not be wrong. All right, Um, here is Sometimes I try to teach you joke techniques. You know how to do humor better. I'm going to read a really funny tweet, but it's only because I want you to understand the technique. So the technique here and I told you this before, is putting things together that don't quite fit. So here's a list of things uh, by Deanna Lorraine. I guess you ran against Pelosi at one point. Lost. So I don't know anything about her except that she's a Republican and she tweeted this and I'm not saying I agree with anything of the list. OK, this this is somebody else's tweet. I'm just reading it Bubble. Wallace isn't a VICTIM showing King ISn't black. Joe Biden isn't winning. CN IS CNN isn't news. Elizabeth Warren ISn't Indian. Colin Kaepernick isn't a hero. Benno O'Rourke isn't Latino. Don Lemon isn't a journalist. Grant a fund Berg isn't a scientist. Meghan Markle isn't a princess now. I laughed for five minutes over that. Now I'm not saying I agree with her points, but the way they're organizes, hilarious, especially with Megan Markle isn't the princess at the end because that would such a throwaway, just nothing but an insult, um, that that the whole thing makes sense, but it doesn't make sense. There are too many things that, individually you'd have to think about a little bit, but because they don't fit together in a list, it just makes you giggle. And I can't stop giggling when I look at it. Not because I agree with that is simply the organization of the thoughts. So this this technique of putting ah bunch of things together? It's hilarious. Now there's also a persuasion technique baked into this, and it's a little different from the laundry list Persuasion laundry list persuasions, where you don't have a strong, strong reason for your argument. So instead of a strong argument, you you just list lots of week woods. That's the laundry list persuasion. There are lots of weak arguments that should add up to nothing, because individually they're all they're all nothing. So if you add a bunch of nothing's together, should still be nothing. But our brains don't hear it that way. If you hear a laundry list of reasons you think yourself well, you know, I recognize that one of those things on that list isn't true. But there's so many things on the list. There must be something on that list. That's true what Deanna Lorraine did in her tweet, which was funny. It's a different kind of list, yet I'll call it a show on Hannity list. All right, here's what is Sean Hannity list This, for example. They'll be five things on the list for them, or things that you know to be true or your Let's say you're politically aligned with Sean Hannity. So you're sure they're true, Even if they're not so that before things, you're pretty sure true. And the fifth thing, it's sort of an opinion, anything, and so if he gives you four things that you know are true or you believe or two and then the fifth thing, you're undecided. But it's in the list with all those other things you believe. It's very persuasive. All right, so, uh, So if you wanted to persuade somebody that some of these things were true, let's say you know some of them you'd agree with, right? We know now that bubble Wallace isn't a victim, but then she throws in. Shaun King isn't black. You know what? You know what she's talking about because he's criticized by the black community for that as well. But is that exactly true? I mean, I haven't checked his DNA, so it feels like no Joe Biden isn't winning. Well, if you're Republican need, maybe you think that CNN CNN isn't news. You agree? Elizabeth Warren isn't Native American. You agree? Colin Kaepernick isn't hero. If you're a Republican, you agree metal barrel, and then it gets gets. So that last one, Meghan Markle isn't a princess by the time you get there is just silly. But it's funny. Anyway, I just wanted to call out the technique. You don't have to agree with any of the points. Did you see the, uh, Steven Cold Bare interview with, uh, John Bolton? If you saw it. There's a very interesting phenomena that I can't determine yes or no if this is true, but I will assert it as my strong professional opinion. All right, so this is professional opinion. It would be hard to know if it's effect and it's this. You should look at my tweet in which I showed the picture of Colbert and Bolt side by side. It's hard to show you things on the screen here, so L big will say. And what I want to do, you see, is cold bears expression compared to Bolton's. Now it's a still photograph, and those could be really misleading because if they catch you in a bad moment, the still photograph doesn't look anything like the way you were if you were moving. But in this case, the still photograph captured exactly what I did. See when I watch the live video and that is, there's a look on cold bears face which, if you're a trained hypnotist and you've seen if you've triggered lots of people into cognitive dissonance, there is a physical look, and cool bear has it the whole way through
